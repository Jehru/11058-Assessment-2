During his early career he spent some time working in the United States and England and after the war he was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne. Between 1953 and 1962, Grounds was part of the Grounds, Romberg and Boyd partnership, in which time he designed the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra.\r\n\r\nThis tour will pick-up and drop-off from the Corner of Parkes Pl W and Queen Elizabeth Terrace. After the tour, participants are invited to Sunday Sessions – music by local acts, a series of large-scale graphic interventions, and an award-winning architectural pop-up wine bar, the Pop Inn.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMid-Century Modernist Bus Tour:\r\nBoyd &amp; Friends\r\n\r\nJoin renowned architecture enthusiast, Martin Miles on a bus tour around Canberra’s best architecture including mid-century modernist icons by Boyd and other architects.\r\n\r\nRobin Boyd (1919-1971), born and educated in Melbourne, was a distinguished architect, writer and social commentator and throughout the 1940s and 1950s was Australia’s leading proponent of the modern movement. Boyd held a lifelong interest in modern architecture tempered by regional concerns. His early work employed structuralist solutions to overcome what he considered to be the deficiencies of most housing of the period and he was a leading practitioner of the post-war Melbourne regional style. The suburban house was often the focus of Boyd’s efforts, both in design and writing, and he enjoyed relatively few opportunities to design major buildings.\r\n\r\nThis tour will pick-up and drop-off from the corner of Watson Street and Gould Street in Turner. After the tour, participants are invited to Sunday Sessions – music by local acts, a series of large-scale graphic interventions, and an award-winning architectural pop-up wine bar, the Pop Inn.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMid Century Modern Tour #3\r\n\r\nUse and Re-Use\r\n\r\nBack by popular demand, this year’s architecture tours will take their cue from the Design Canberra theme: geometry. The Design Canberra festival will celebrate the strong geometry present throughout our city and the ways it creates human, creative and global connections.\r\n\r\nThe tours will introduce people to architects who have used geometric forms in a variety of ways to shape spaces for people. How have the designers of these houses and buildings used geometric principles to create dwellings that comfort and inspire their occupants? From simple rectilinear forms and modular designs to complex examples using the Pythagorean spiral and hemicycle, we’ll visit some of Canberra’s most significant houses and buildings.\r\n\r\nThis tour looks at the future of mid-century design. We’ll visit mid-century houses, an embassy and a church. How are they meeting the needs of occupants today, and how are people adapting them for current and future needs?\r\n\r\nThe tours will be presented by local architecture enthusiast and author of Canberra House, Martin Miles. The tours will also feature a variety of special guests, including internationally renowned architects and planners. Please meet at the Civic Square bus stop at 8:50am. (Buses will depart and return to this location each week.)\r\n\r\nPlease note that the bus, as well as some locations, will require stair access as well as moderate walking.

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.\r\n\r\nThe original house was an excellent example of Seidler’s early work in Australia and was probably his first commission outside Sydney. It is one of only two detached houses that Seidler designed in Canberra. The other, at 12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor, has been demolished. In Seidler’s book ‘Houses, Interiors and Projects’ (Horwitz, 1959), the house is highlighted as an example that demonstrated the design philosophy central to his architecture during this period.\r\n\r\nThe original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.\r\n\r\nThe split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nThe house has been modified and extended twice: the first time in 1957–60 by Seidler and the second time in 1978 by a local architect. The Seidler work added two bedrooms to the north east, a new laundry and an extension of the kitchen and dining room into the original laundry space and courtyard. The original design aesthetic was maintained with matching wall finishes and roofing, but the upper level planning themes were largely changed by this extension.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room. The cantilevered balcony off the main bedroom has also been enclosed, which has changed the appearance of the western facade. This was an important design feature, being an expression of the internal spaces, structure and architectural style.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Fenner House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(8 MONARO CRESCENT, RED HILL)</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fenner-house-1.jpg" width="542" height="219" />\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House is located within the Red Hill heritage precinct. It was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952–53 for Professor and Mrs Frank Fenner, and built by Karl Schreiner in 1953-54.\r\n\r\nThe house is one of Canberra’s best examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with its long unbroken roofline, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Manning Clark House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House represents a simple, bold, well planned and designed house that appropriately integrates the building with the corner block, set in a garden designed by important Canberra landscape architect Professor Lindsay Pryor. The design of the house was unique and advanced in Canberra at the time and is a significant work of Robin Boyd, a prominent Australian architect.\r\n\r\nThe house is set well back diagonally on a large corner block that slopes several metres from rear to front. The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.\r\n\r\nThe construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear, the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper than the original rear wing.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>FORREST TOWNHOUSES</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(3 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/forrest-townhouses-3.jpg" width="516" height="387" />\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are a group of five townhouses, a small attached bedsitter and a separate courtyard house linked by carports and a covered walkway. Designed by Roy Grounds as a speculative venture in 1959, they are the only townhouses in Canberra designed by Grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are an important example of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines, widely projecting eaves and glass walls with regularly spaced timber mullions. With their cubiform overall shape and large areas of glazing, the townhouses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. They can be compared with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Vasey Crescent houses (1960) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are the earliest and probably the only example in Canberra of the design philosophy of Le Corbusier’s Maison Citrohan that includes a double height living space.\r\n\r\nThe five two storey townhouses are set side by side with high courtyard walls on the north property boundary. The courtyard walls facing Dominion Circuit did not comply with local NCDC guidelines when constructed and were demolished. They were rebuilt at a later date on condition that they be hidden by a planting of bamboo, which remains to this day.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses have a two storey height living space, which is screened by sliding doors from the dining, kitchen and entry area. Above this is a gallery with a built in desk, which overlooks the living area. Behind the gallery are two bedrooms, a dressing room and a bathroom. The single level courtyard house has a large open living area facing north and opening to a courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are constructed with load bearing concrete blocks, a concrete slab to the ground floor and timber and steel framing to the upper floor and flat metal deck roof. The timber-framed glazing is painted white externally, while interior finishes are low key: face concrete blockwork walls, limed ash joinery and panelling and compressed straw ceilings with exposed rafters and beams.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Manning Clark House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(11 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThe Manning Clark House, at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952 for Professor and Mrs Manning Clark.\r\nThe house is typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style and Boyd’s Peninsula House Design, with its low pitched gable roof, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Fenner House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe house has great significance for its association with Professor Manning Clark. The efforts of the Manning Clark House\r\norganisation will ensure that the house is conserved and made available to future generations of Australians for cultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well\r\nlaid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber\r\nframed windows and metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance.\r\nEither side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south.\r\nThe walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other.\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to thestudy is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\nThe living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves.\r\nThe living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>McKeown Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(109 IRVINE STREET, WATSON)</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThese two houses at 109 Irvine Street, Watson are unusual in that they were designed 30 years apart by the same architect for the same client on the same block of land. Both were designed by Enrico Taglietti and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\r\n\r\nTaglietti designed this house for the McKeown family in 1965. The plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\r\n\r\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\r\n\r\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Vasey Crescent Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(42, 44 AND 46 VASEY CRESCENT, CAMPBELL )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vasey-cres-5.jpg" width="455" height="341" />This houses were designed by Roy Grounds of the firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd in 1960. As a result of a collaboration between the owners of each block, the three houses were designed by the same architect and built as a coordinated group. When Grounds received the commission to design the Victorian Arts Centre, management of the Vasey Crescent group of houses was taken over by Robin Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe houses are fine examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines and widely projecting eaves. With their strong formal composition, large areas of glazing and open plan living areas, the houses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. Note the similarities with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Forrest Townhouses (1959) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe site for the Vasey Crescent houses is on an east-west ridge running from Russell Hill, with a fall to the street. Each house has a northern aspect but through staggered siting, each house has western views over the city. Number 46 is sited closest to the road; 42 the furthest.\r\n\r\nThe houses are designed on three levels, with the ground floor of each at the same level. All have Besser concrete block walls, timber framed fenestration panels, flat roofs with metal decking and overhanging eaves and strong rectilinear forms. Two of the three houses are substantially original.\r\n<h2>42 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nThe first level consists of a garage, studio and store. Level two has an external balcony running the full width of the house and along the western facade, with the entry hallway a central zone with stairway. This level originally contained three bedrooms, a laundry and a bathroom. On level three the staircase opens to an open plan reception, living and dining area; this level also contains the main kitchen and master bedroom.\r\n<h2>44 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nUnfortunately, number 44 has been extended on three occasions (1973, 1976 and 1990). The original house consisted of a garage and storeroom on the lower level. An external staircase led to the entry on the second level, which contained large living and dining areas, playroom and kitchen with full width glazing looking out to the west. The third level contained three bedrooms, a study and bathroom.\r\n<h2>46 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nOn the lower floor is a garage and storeroom. The second level entry is planned as a rectangular wing on a north-south axis. External stairs lead up to the entrance, opening to entry hall, dining, kitchen and living room facing north, the full width of the wing. The main bedroom and ensuite are also at this level. Stairs lead up to the third level, planned as a children’s wing, with a central playroom, four small bedrooms and a bathroom.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Houses', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'houses', '', '', '2020-10-05 04:38:52', '2020-10-05 04:38:52', '', 0, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/?page_id=29', 0, 'page', '', 0),

The Territory is a hilly environment containing much natural bushland. The tree-clad, landscaped city itself has been described by architecture historian Jennifer Taylor as “a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_50" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-50" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/canberra-photo-from-NAA-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /> Canberra - Photo from NAA[/caption]\r\n<h3>THE 1930S AND 1940S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s beginnings as a planned city established conditions that were different from Australia’s other major cities. Early development came in fits and starts, with government indecision, World Wars and the Great Depression severely limiting the amount of public building undertaken before 1950. Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned houses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.\r\n\r\nWhat of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practicing architects in Canberra up until the late 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little appetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site. The best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.\r\n<h3>THE 1950S</h3>\r\nThe population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra. The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra. As a result of these influences, there are some excellent examples of post-war Melbourne (Grounds and Boyd) and post-war international architecture (Sydney architects Seidler and Ancher) from this period in Canberra, some of national importance.\r\n\r\n[Canberra is] … a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects. Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960 In Experiments in Modern Living: Scientists and the National Capital Private House 1925-1970, Milton Cameron has examined how a group of scientists, brought to Canberra to take up leading roles in the establishment of national scientific institutions, commissioned private houses that rejected previous architectural styles and wholeheartedly embraced modernist ideologies and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd established an office in Canberra, located in one of the Forrest Townhouses designed by Grounds. Roy Grounds, for example, who designed the Australian Academy of Science building formed relationships here with prominent scientists such as Sir Otto Frankel,\r\nand later designed Frankel’s house in Campbell.\r\n<h3>THE 1960S</h3>\r\nWith the NCDC in full swing, and Canberra resembling a construction site, the 1960s witnessed growth rates of 10% per year and by 1970 the population had climbed above 140,000. The city was transformed, with the development of new satellite towns in Woden and Belconnen, the creation of Lake Burley Griffin and the commencement of national institutions in the central national area. Notable buildings completed for national and community institutions include the Academy of Science (Roy Grounds, 1958) and the National Library of Australia (Bunning and Madden, 1967).\r\nThe decade saw further important examples of Melbourne regional and post-war international architecture designed and built, together with the emerging Sydney regional style and beginnings of medium density housing. The first medium density housing development sponsored by the NCDC in Swinger Hill created a sensation when it was opened for exhibition on two weekends in April 1972, attracting over 20,000 visitors.\r\n\r\nThe major developments in Australian post-war architecture are well represented in Canberra’s houses of the 1960s:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The post-war Melbourne regional architecture of Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd</li>\r\n 	<li>Examples of post-war international style houses from Harry Seidler</li>\r\n 	<li>Sydney regional architecture by Ian McKay, Allen, Jack and Cottier and Ken Woolley</li>\r\n 	<li>The organic architecture of Enrico Taglietti</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>THE 1970S AND 1980S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s high growth rate continued in the early part of the decade and large scale office development accompanied a rapid expansion of the town centres in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong. By 1976 the population had reached 203,000. The Sydney regional style became more widespread in the early part of the decade, particularly in developing bushland suburbs such as Aranda. The 1970s also saw a further increase in medium density development as the NCDC began actively promoting the idea of townhouse living.\r\n\r\nThe city of Canberra matured in the 1980s, with the population approaching 300,000 and greater diversity apparent in lifestyles, employment and recreation. The suburbs and town centre of Tuggeranong were constructed to the south, and the new town centre of Gungahlin planned in the north.\r\nMeanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage. The marked increase in the regeneration of central suburbs has provided opportunities for architects, and produced a number of interesting and award winning houses in this period. But it’s a two-edged sword: this regeneration also threatens some significant older houses with demolition and redevelopment.\r\n<h3>ABOUT THE SITE</h3>\r\nThis site tells the story of modernist residential architecture and the development of Canberra, through profiles of significant Canberra houses, architect biographies and articles about architectural styles and heritage issues. I hope that by bringing this story together online it might stimulate an interest in Canberra’s mid-twentieth century modernist heritage.\r\n\r\nThe content for the site has been drawn from citations in the Australian Institute of Architects’ (AIA) Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture (RSTCA), my own research and conversations with house owners.

During his early career he spent some time working in the United States and England and after the war he was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne. Between 1953 and 1962, Grounds was part of the Grounds, Romberg and Boyd partnership, in which time he designed the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra.\r\n\r\nThis tour will pick-up and drop-off from the Corner of Parkes Pl W and Queen Elizabeth Terrace. After the tour, participants are invited to Sunday Sessions – music by local acts, a series of large-scale graphic interventions, and an award-winning architectural pop-up wine bar, the Pop Inn.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMid-Century Modernist Bus Tour:\r\nBoyd &amp; Friends\r\n\r\nJoin renowned architecture enthusiast, Martin Miles on a bus tour around Canberra’s best architecture including mid-century modernist icons by Boyd and other architects.\r\n\r\nRobin Boyd (1919-1971), born and educated in Melbourne, was a distinguished architect, writer and social commentator and throughout the 1940s and 1950s was Australia’s leading proponent of the modern movement. Boyd held a lifelong interest in modern architecture tempered by regional concerns. His early work employed structuralist solutions to overcome what he considered to be the deficiencies of most housing of the period and he was a leading practitioner of the post-war Melbourne regional style. The suburban house was often the focus of Boyd’s efforts, both in design and writing, and he enjoyed relatively few opportunities to design major buildings.\r\n\r\nThis tour will pick-up and drop-off from the corner of Watson Street and Gould Street in Turner. After the tour, participants are invited to Sunday Sessions – music by local acts, a series of large-scale graphic interventions, and an award-winning architectural pop-up wine bar, the Pop Inn.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMid Century Modern Tour #3\r\n\r\nUse and Re-Use\r\n\r\nBack by popular demand, this year’s architecture tours will take their cue from the Design Canberra theme: geometry. The Design Canberra festival will celebrate the strong geometry present throughout our city and the ways it creates human, creative and global connections.\r\n\r\nThe tours will introduce people to architects who have used geometric forms in a variety of ways to shape spaces for people. How have the designers of these houses and buildings used geometric principles to create dwellings that comfort and inspire their occupants? From simple rectilinear forms and modular designs to complex examples using the Pythagorean spiral and hemicycle, we’ll visit some of Canberra’s most significant houses and buildings.\r\n\r\nThis tour looks at the future of mid-century design. We’ll visit mid-century houses, an embassy and a church. How are they meeting the needs of occupants today, and how are people adapting them for current and future needs?\r\n\r\nThe tours will be presented by local architecture enthusiast and author of Canberra House, Martin Miles. The tours will also feature a variety of special guests, including internationally renowned architects and planners. Please meet at the Civic Square bus stop at 8:50am. (Buses will depart and return to this location each week.)\r\n\r\nPlease note that the bus, as well as some locations, will require stair access as well as moderate walking.

The Territory is a hilly environment containing much natural bushland. The tree-clad, landscaped city itself has been described by architecture historian Jennifer Taylor as “a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects.”\r\n<h3>THE 1930S AND 1940S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s beginnings as a planned city established conditions that were different from Australia’s other major cities. Early development came in fits and starts, with government indecision, World Wars and the Great Depression severely limiting the amount of public building\r\nundertaken before 1950. Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned\r\nhouses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.\r\n\r\nWhat of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practicing architects in Canberra up until the late 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little appetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site. The best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.\r\n<h3>THE 1950S</h3>\r\nThe population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra. The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra. As a result of these influences, there are some excellent examples of post-war Melbourne (Grounds and Boyd) and post-war international architecture\r\n(Sydney architects Seidler and Ancher) from this period in Canberra, some of national importance.\r\n\r\n[Canberra is] … a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects. Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960 In Experiments in Modern Living: Scientists and the National Capital Private House 1925-1970, Milton Cameron has examined how a group of scientists, brought to Canberra to take up leading roles in the establishment of national scientific institutions, commissioned private houses that rejected previous architectural styles and wholeheartedly embraced modernist ideologies and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd established an office in Canberra, located in one of the Forrest Townhouses designed by Grounds. Roy Grounds, for example, who designed the Australian Academy of Science building formed relationships here with prominent scientists such as Sir Otto Frankel,\r\nand later designed Frankel’s house in Campbell.\r\n<h3>THE 1960S</h3>\r\nWith the NCDC in full swing, and Canberra resembling a construction site, the 1960s witnessed growth rates of 10% per year and by 1970 the population had climbed above 140,000. The city was transformed, with the development of new satellite towns in Woden and Belconnen, the creation of Lake Burley Griffin and the commencement of national institutions in the central national area. Notable buildings completed for national and community institutions include the Academy of Science (Roy Grounds, 1958) and the National Library of Australia (Bunning and Madden, 1967).\r\nThe decade saw further important examples of Melbourne regional and post-war international architecture designed and built, together with the emerging Sydney regional style and beginnings of medium density housing.

The Territory is a hilly environment containing much natural bushland. The tree-clad, landscaped city itself has been described by architecture historian Jennifer Taylor as “a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_50" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-50" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/canberra-photo-from-NAA-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /> Canberra - Photo from NAA[/caption]\r\n<h3>THE 1930S AND 1940S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s beginnings as a planned city established conditions that were different from Australia’s other major cities. Early development came in fits and starts, with government indecision, World Wars and the Great Depression severely limiting the amount of public building undertaken before 1950. Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned houses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.\r\n\r\nWhat of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practicing architects in Canberra up until the late 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little appetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site. The best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.\r\n<h3>THE 1950S</h3>\r\nThe population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra. The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra. As a result of these influences, there are some excellent examples of post-war Melbourne (Grounds and Boyd) and post-war international architecture (Sydney architects Seidler and Ancher) from this period in Canberra, some of national importance.\r\n\r\n[Canberra is] … a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects. Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960 In Experiments in Modern Living: Scientists and the National Capital Private House 1925-1970, Milton Cameron has examined how a group of scientists, brought to Canberra to take up leading roles in the establishment of national scientific institutions, commissioned private houses that rejected previous architectural styles and wholeheartedly embraced modernist ideologies and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd established an office in Canberra, located in one of the Forrest Townhouses designed by Grounds. Roy Grounds, for example, who designed the Australian Academy of Science building formed relationships here with prominent scientists such as Sir Otto Frankel,\r\nand later designed Frankel’s house in Campbell.\r\n<h3>THE 1960S</h3>\r\nWith the NCDC in full swing, and Canberra resembling a construction site, the 1960s witnessed growth rates of 10% per year and by 1970 the population had climbed above 140,000. The city was transformed, with the development of new satellite towns in Woden and Belconnen, the creation of Lake Burley Griffin and the commencement of national institutions in the central national area. Notable buildings completed for national and community institutions include the Academy of Science (Roy Grounds, 1958) and the National Library of Australia (Bunning and Madden, 1967).\r\nThe decade saw further important examples of Melbourne regional and post-war international architecture designed and built, together with the emerging Sydney regional style and beginnings of medium density housing. The first medium density housing development sponsored by the NCDC in Swinger Hill created a sensation when it was opened for exhibition on two weekends in April 1972, attracting over 20,000 visitors.\r\n\r\nThe major developments in Australian post-war architecture are well represented in Canberra’s houses of the 1960s:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The post-war Melbourne regional architecture of Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd</li>\r\n 	<li>Examples of post-war international style houses from Harry Seidler</li>\r\n 	<li>Sydney regional architecture by Ian McKay, Allen, Jack and Cottier and Ken Woolley</li>\r\n 	<li>The organic architecture of Enrico Taglietti</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>THE 1970S AND 1980S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s high growth rate continued in the early part of the decade and large scale office development accompanied a rapid expansion of the town centres in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong. By 1976 the population had reached 203,000. The Sydney regional style became more widespread in the early part of the decade, particularly in developing bushland suburbs such as Aranda. The 1970s also saw a further increase in medium density development as the NCDC began actively promoting the idea of townhouse living.\r\n\r\nThe city of Canberra matured in the 1980s, with the population approaching 300,000 and greater diversity apparent in lifestyles, employment and recreation. The suburbs and town centre of Tuggeranong were constructed to the south, and the new town centre of Gungahlin planned in the north.\r\nMeanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage. The marked increase in the regeneration of central suburbs has provided opportunities for architects, and produced a number of interesting and award winning houses in this period. But it’s a two-edged sword: this regeneration also threatens some significant older houses with demolition and redevelopment.\r\n<h3>ABOUT THE SITE</h3>\r\nThis site tells the story of modernist residential architecture and the development of Canberra, through profiles of significant Canberra houses, architect biographies and articles about architectural styles and heritage issues.

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.\r\n\r\nThe original house was an excellent example of Seidler’s early work in Australia and was probably his first commission outside Sydney. It is one of only two detached houses that Seidler designed in Canberra. The other, at 12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor, has been demolished. In Seidler’s book ‘Houses, Interiors and Projects’ (Horwitz, 1959), the house is highlighted as an example that demonstrated the design philosophy central to his architecture during this period.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.\r\n\r\nThe split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nThe house has been modified and extended twice: the first time in 1957–60 by Seidler and the second time in 1978 by a local architect. The Seidler work added two bedrooms to the north east, a new laundry and an extension of the kitchen and dining room into the original laundry space and courtyard. The original design aesthetic was maintained with matching wall finishes and roofing, but the upper level planning themes were largely changed by this extension.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room. The cantilevered balcony off the main bedroom has also been enclosed, which has changed the appearance of the western facade. This was an important design feature, being an expression of the internal spaces, structure and architectural style.\r\n<h1>Fenner House</h1>\r\n&nbsp;', 'Houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 03:22:57', '2020-10-05 03:22:57', '', 29, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/29-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952–53 for Professor and Mrs Frank Fenner, and built by Karl Schreiner in 1953-54.\r\n\r\nThe house is one of Canberra’s best examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with its long unbroken roofline, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Manning Clark House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House represents a simple, bold, well planned and designed house that appropriately integrates the building with the corner block, set in a garden designed by important Canberra landscape architect Professor Lindsay Pryor. The design of the house was unique and advanced in Canberra at the time and is a significant work of Robin Boyd, a prominent Australian architect.\r\n\r\nThe house is set well back diagonally on a large corner block that slopes several metres from rear to front. The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.\r\n\r\nThe construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear, the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper than the original rear wing.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>FORREST TOWNHOUSES</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(3 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/forrest-townhouses-3.jpg" width="516" height="387" />\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are a group of five townhouses, a small attached bedsitter and a separate courtyard house linked by carports and a covered walkway. Designed by Roy Grounds as a speculative venture in 1959, they are the only townhouses in Canberra designed by Grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are an important example of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines, widely projecting eaves and glass walls with regularly spaced timber mullions. With their cubiform overall shape and large areas of glazing, the townhouses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. They can be compared with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Vasey Crescent houses (1960) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are the earliest and probably the only example in Canberra of the design philosophy of Le Corbusier’s Maison Citrohan that includes a double height living space.\r\n\r\nThe five two storey townhouses are set side by side with high courtyard walls on the north property boundary. The courtyard walls facing Dominion Circuit did not comply with local NCDC guidelines when constructed and were demolished. They were rebuilt at a later date on condition that they be hidden by a planting of bamboo, which remains to this day.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses have a two storey height living space, which is screened by sliding doors from the dining, kitchen and entry area. Above this is a gallery with a built in desk, which overlooks the living area. Behind the gallery are two bedrooms, a dressing room and a bathroom. The single level courtyard house has a large open living area facing north and opening to a courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are constructed with load bearing concrete blocks, a concrete slab to the ground floor and timber and steel framing to the upper floor and flat metal deck roof. The timber-framed glazing is painted white externally, while interior finishes are low key: face concrete blockwork walls, limed ash joinery and panelling and compressed straw ceilings with exposed rafters and beams.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Manning Clark House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(11 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThe Manning Clark House, at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952 for Professor and Mrs Manning Clark.\r\nThe house is typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style and Boyd’s Peninsula House Design, with its low pitched gable roof, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Fenner House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe house has great significance for its association with Professor Manning Clark. The efforts of the Manning Clark House\r\norganisation will ensure that the house is conserved and made available to future generations of Australians for cultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well\r\nlaid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber\r\nframed windows and metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance.\r\nEither side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south.\r\nThe walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other.\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to thestudy is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\nThe living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves.\r\nThe living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>McKeown Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(109 IRVINE STREET, WATSON)</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThese two houses at 109 Irvine Street, Watson are unusual in that they were designed 30 years apart by the same architect for the same client on the same block of land. Both were designed by Enrico Taglietti and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\r\n\r\nTaglietti designed this house for the McKeown family in 1965. The plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\r\n\r\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\r\n\r\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Vasey Crescent Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(42, 44 AND 46 VASEY CRESCENT, CAMPBELL )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vasey-cres-5.jpg" width="455" height="341" />This houses were designed by Roy Grounds of the firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd in 1960. As a result of a collaboration between the owners of each block, the three houses were designed by the same architect and built as a coordinated group. When Grounds received the commission to design the Victorian Arts Centre, management of the Vasey Crescent group of houses was taken over by Robin Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe houses are fine examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines and widely projecting eaves. With their strong formal composition, large areas of glazing and open plan living areas, the houses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. Note the similarities with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Forrest Townhouses (1959) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe site for the Vasey Crescent houses is on an east-west ridge running from Russell Hill, with a fall to the street. Each house has a northern aspect but through staggered siting, each house has western views over the city. Number 46 is sited closest to the road; 42 the furthest.\r\n\r\nThe houses are designed on three levels, with the ground floor of each at the same level. All have Besser concrete block walls, timber framed fenestration panels, flat roofs with metal decking and overhanging eaves and strong rectilinear forms. Two of the three houses are substantially original.\r\n<h2>42 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nThe first level consists of a garage, studio and store. Level two has an external balcony running the full width of the house and along the western facade, with the entry hallway a central zone with stairway. This level originally contained three bedrooms, a laundry and a bathroom. On level three the staircase opens to an open plan reception, living and dining area; this level also contains the main kitchen and master bedroom.\r\n<h2>44 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nUnfortunately, number 44 has been extended on three occasions (1973, 1976 and 1990). The original house consisted of a garage and storeroom on the lower level. An external staircase led to the entry on the second level, which contained large living and dining areas, playroom and kitchen with full width glazing looking out to the west. The third level contained three bedrooms, a study and bathroom.\r\n<h2>46 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nOn the lower floor is a garage and storeroom. The second level entry is planned as a rectangular wing on a north-south axis. External stairs lead up to the entrance, opening to entry hall, dining, kitchen and living room facing north, the full width of the wing. The main bedroom and ensuite are also at this level. Stairs lead up to the third level, planned as a children’s wing, with a central playroom, four small bedrooms and a bathroom.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-autosave-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 04:38:35', '2020-10-05 04:38:35', '', 29, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/29-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.\r\n\r\nThe original house was an excellent example of Seidler’s early work in Australia and was probably his first commission outside Sydney. It is one of only two detached houses that Seidler designed in Canberra. The other, at 12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor, has been demolished. In Seidler’s book ‘Houses, Interiors and Projects’ (Horwitz, 1959), the house is highlighted as an example that demonstrated the design philosophy central to his architecture during this period.\r\n\r\nThe original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.\r\n\r\nThe split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nThe house has been modified and extended twice: the first time in 1957–60 by Seidler and the second time in 1978 by a local architect. The Seidler work added two bedrooms to the north east, a new laundry and an extension of the kitchen and dining room into the original laundry space and courtyard. The original design aesthetic was maintained with matching wall finishes and roofing, but the upper level planning themes were largely changed by this extension.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room. The cantilevered balcony off the main bedroom has also been enclosed, which has changed the appearance of the western facade. This was an important design feature, being an expression of the internal spaces, structure and architectural style.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Fenner House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(8 MONARO CRESCENT, RED HILL)</h3>\r\nThe Fenner House, at 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill, is located within the Red Hill heritage precinct. It was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952–53 for Professor and Mrs Frank Fenner, and built by Karl Schreiner in 1953-54. Professor Frank Fenner AC, CMG, MBE, FAA (21 December 1914 – 22 November 2010) was one of Australia’s leading virologists, noted for his work on myxomatosis and smallpox, and has won three of the world’s most prestigious awards: the Albert Einstein World Award for Science (August 2000), the Japan Prize for preventative medicine and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society (London).\r\n\r\nThe house is one of Canberra’s best examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with its long unbroken roofline, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Manning Clark House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nOther houses in Canberra designed by Boyd include the abovementioned Clark House (1952), the Roche house in Bedford Street, Deakin (1954), the W G Verge house at 204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1963) and 12 Marawa Place, Aranda (1968–69).\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House at 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill, is listed on the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. It is regarded by the AIA as being a very good example of the post-war Melbourne regional style with its large areas of glazing and vertical boarding, long unbroken roofline, metal roof and raked ceilings.\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House represents a simple, bold, well planned and designed house that appropriately integrates the building with the corner block, set in a garden designed by important Canberra landscape architect Professor Lindsay Pryor. The design of the house was unique and advanced in Canberra at the time and is a significant work of Robin Boyd, a prominent Australian architect.\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House reflects the close Melbourne ties of many early academics at the Australian National University. The house was the first winner of the Meritorious Architecture Award of the Canberra Area Committee of the AIA in 1956.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe house is set well back diagonally on a large corner block that slopes several metres from rear to front. The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.\r\n\r\nThe construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear, the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper than the original rear wing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 04:03:28', '2020-10-05 04:03:28', '', 29, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/29-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

Designed by Roy Grounds as a speculative venture in 1959, they are the only townhouses in Canberra designed by Grounds. Grounds’ own unit was the third townhouse from the west, while the courtyard house was used as the Grounds, Romberg and Boyd office in Canberra as well as the residence of Grounds’ full time architect assistant, Fritz Suenderman and family. The bedsitter was originally leased to a local architectural firm.\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are an important example of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines, widely projecting eaves and glass walls with regularly spaced timber mullions. With their cubiform overall shape and large areas of glazing, the townhouses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. They can be compared with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Vasey Crescent houses (1960) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are listed on the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. They are regarded by the AIA as being an important example of the post-war Melbourne regional style and as having a strong association with Roy Grounds. The townhouses are of national significance.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are the earliest and probably the only example in Canberra of the design philosophy of Le Corbusier’s Maison Citrohan that includes a double height living space.\r\n\r\nVarious houses in the group have been owned or occupied by prominent Australians. Apart from Grounds himself, Sir William McMahon, Prime Minister of Australia from 1970–72, lived in the single level courtyard house and Aldo Giurgola, the principle design architect of the New Parliament House, lived in the westernmost townhouse.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe five two storey townhouses are set side by side with high courtyard walls on the north property boundary. The courtyard walls facing Dominion Circuit did not comply with local NCDC guidelines when constructed and were demolished. They were rebuilt at a later date on condition that they be hidden by a planting of bamboo, which remains to this day.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses have a two storey height living space, which is screened by sliding doors from the dining, kitchen and entry area. Above this is a gallery with a built in desk, which overlooks the living area. Behind the gallery are two bedrooms, a dressing room and a bathroom. The single level courtyard house has a large open living area facing north and opening to a courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are constructed with load bearing concrete blocks, a concrete slab to the ground floor and timber and steel framing to the upper floor and flat metal deck roof. The timber-framed glazing is painted white externally, while interior finishes are low key: face concrete blockwork walls, limed ash joinery and panelling and compressed straw ceilings with exposed rafters and beams.\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses were built by Civil and Civic (who also built 42 Vasey Crescent).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n11 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST (1952)\r\n\r\nThe Manning Clark House, at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952 for Professor and Mrs Manning Clark.\r\nThe house is typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style and Boyd’s Peninsula House Design, with its low pitched gable roof,\r\nwidely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Fenner House,\r\nalso designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Manning Clark is probably the most influential and well known Australian historian and virtually all of his\r\npublished work was written in the study of this house. He is best known for his epic History of Australia, published in six\r\nvolumes from 1962 and 1987. Manning Clark House was established as an incorporated association in 1998 by Dymphna Clark, to serve\r\nthe intellectual and cultural interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\nThe Clark House at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest, is listed on the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects Register\r\nof Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. It is regarded by the AIA as being an innovative design solution to the specific\r\nrequirements of Professor Manning Clark and a very good example of the Melbourne regional style of Robin Boyd, a leading figure\r\nin post-war Australian architecture.\r\n\r\nClark House plan\r\nTHE ORIGINAL FLOORPLAN\r\n\r\nThe house has great significance for its association with Professor Manning Clark. The efforts of the Manning Clark House\r\norganisation will ensure that the house is conserved and made available to future generations of Australians for cultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well\r\nlaid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber\r\nframed windows and metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance.\r\nEither side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south.\r\nThe walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other.\r\nSimilar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to the\r\nstudy is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\nThe living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves.\r\nThe living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up\r\nlevel of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a\r\ngalah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n\r\nOnly minor alterations have been made to house. A pergola was added to extend the sunshade over the north facing windows of the\r\nstudy and a carport was built on to the side of the house near the entry area. The house is in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nSOURCE\r\n\r\nAustralian Institute of Architects RSTCA Citation No. R108\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMCKEOWN HOUSES, 109 IRVINE STREET, WATSON (1965 AND 1993)\r\n\r\nThese two houses at 109 Irvine Street, Watson are unusual in that they were designed 30 years apart by the same architect for the same client on the same block of land. Both were designed by Enrico Taglietti and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\r\n\r\nTaglietti has designed many buildings and houses in and around Canberra. The most notable of his buildings are the Centre Cinema (1966); Dickson Library (1969); Italian Embassy (1969); Apostolic Nunciature (1977); Giralang Primary School (1977); Australian War Memorial Store, Mitchell (1979) and the Dickson Health Centre (1981). Other houses include 12 Scarborough Street, Red Hill (1963), 19 Downes Place, Hughes (1965), and the Paterson House at 7 Juad Place, Aranda (1970).\r\n\r\nMCKEOWN HOUSE I\r\n\r\nMcKeown House II\r\nMCKEOWN HOUSE II\r\n\r\nTaglietti designed this house for the McKeown family in 1965. The plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\r\n\r\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\r\n\r\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\r\n\r\nMCKEOWN HOUSE II\r\n\r\nIn 1993 Taglietti was engaged by the original owner to design an additional home on the block behind the original house. The new two-storey design contrasts markedly with the earlier horizontally proportioned dwelling. While the walls of both are white, the emphasis is on vertical lines in the proportions, with a steeply pitched roof and an adjacent tower-like element.\r\n\r\nSOURCE\r\n\r\nKen Charlton, The Career of Enrico Taglietti, RAIA, 2007\r\nAnn Whitelaw, ‘Wedge Shaped House Catches The Eye’, The Canberra Times, 9 December 1969\r\nAustralian House and Garden, August 1969, pp34–35', 'Houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 04:09:31', '2020-10-05 04:09:31', '', 29, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/29-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.\r\n\r\nThe original house was an excellent example of Seidler’s early work in Australia and was probably his first commission outside Sydney. It is one of only two detached houses that Seidler designed in Canberra. The other, at 12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor, has been demolished. In Seidler’s book ‘Houses, Interiors and Projects’ (Horwitz, 1959), the house is highlighted as an example that demonstrated the design philosophy central to his architecture during this period.\r\n\r\nThe original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.\r\n\r\nThe split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nThe house has been modified and extended twice: the first time in 1957–60 by Seidler and the second time in 1978 by a local architect. The Seidler work added two bedrooms to the north east, a new laundry and an extension of the kitchen and dining room into the original laundry space and courtyard. The original design aesthetic was maintained with matching wall finishes and roofing, but the upper level planning themes were largely changed by this extension.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room. The cantilevered balcony off the main bedroom has also been enclosed, which has changed the appearance of the western facade. This was an important design feature, being an expression of the internal spaces, structure and architectural style.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Fenner House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(8 MONARO CRESCENT, RED HILL)</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fenner-house-1.jpg" width="680" height="275" />\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House is located within the Red Hill heritage precinct. It was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952–53 for Professor and Mrs Frank Fenner, and built by Karl Schreiner in 1953-54.\r\n\r\nThe house is one of Canberra’s best examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with its long unbroken roofline, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Manning Clark House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe Fenner House represents a simple, bold, well planned and designed house that appropriately integrates the building with the corner block, set in a garden designed by important Canberra landscape architect Professor Lindsay Pryor. The design of the house was unique and advanced in Canberra at the time and is a significant work of Robin Boyd, a prominent Australian architect.\r\n\r\nThe house is set well back diagonally on a large corner block that slopes several metres from rear to front. The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.\r\n\r\nThe construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear, the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper than the original rear wing.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>FORREST TOWNHOUSES</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(3 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/forrest-townhouses-3.jpg" width="659" height="494" />\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are a group of five townhouses, a small attached bedsitter and a separate courtyard house linked by carports and a covered walkway. Designed by Roy Grounds as a speculative venture in 1959, they are the only townhouses in Canberra designed by Grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Forrest Townhouses are an important example of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines, widely projecting eaves and glass walls with regularly spaced timber mullions. With their cubiform overall shape and large areas of glazing, the townhouses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. They can be compared with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Vasey Crescent houses (1960) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are the earliest and probably the only example in Canberra of the design philosophy of Le Corbusier’s Maison Citrohan that includes a double height living space.\r\n\r\nThe five two storey townhouses are set side by side with high courtyard walls on the north property boundary. The courtyard walls facing Dominion Circuit did not comply with local NCDC guidelines when constructed and were demolished. They were rebuilt at a later date on condition that they be hidden by a planting of bamboo, which remains to this day.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses have a two storey height living space, which is screened by sliding doors from the dining, kitchen and entry area. Above this is a gallery with a built in desk, which overlooks the living area. Behind the gallery are two bedrooms, a dressing room and a bathroom. The single level courtyard house has a large open living area facing north and opening to a courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe townhouses are constructed with load bearing concrete blocks, a concrete slab to the ground floor and timber and steel framing to the upper floor and flat metal deck roof. The timber-framed glazing is painted white externally, while interior finishes are low key: face concrete blockwork walls, limed ash joinery and panelling and compressed straw ceilings with exposed rafters and beams.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Manning Clark House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(11 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThe Manning Clark House, at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952 for Professor and Mrs Manning Clark.\r\nThe house is typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style and Boyd’s Peninsula House Design, with its low pitched gable roof, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Fenner House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe house has great significance for its association with Professor Manning Clark. The efforts of the Manning Clark House\r\norganisation will ensure that the house is conserved and made available to future generations of Australians for cultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well\r\nlaid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber\r\nframed windows and metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance.\r\nEither side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south.\r\nThe walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other.\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to thestudy is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\nThe living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves.\r\nThe living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>McKeown Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(109 IRVINE STREET, WATSON)</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThese two houses at 109 Irvine Street, Watson are unusual in that they were designed 30 years apart by the same architect for the same client on the same block of land. Both were designed by Enrico Taglietti and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\r\n\r\nTaglietti designed this house for the McKeown family in 1965. The plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\r\n\r\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\r\n\r\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Vasey Crescent Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(42, 44 AND 46 VASEY CRESCENT, CAMPBELL )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vasey-cres-5.jpg" />This houses were designed by Roy Grounds of the firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd in 1960. As a result of a collaboration between the owners of each block, the three houses were designed by the same architect and built as a coordinated group. When Grounds received the commission to design the Victorian Arts Centre, management of the Vasey Crescent group of houses was taken over by Robin Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe houses are fine examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines and widely projecting eaves. With their strong formal composition, large areas of glazing and open plan living areas, the houses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. Note the similarities with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Forrest Townhouses (1959) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe site for the Vasey Crescent houses is on an east-west ridge running from Russell Hill, with a fall to the street. Each house has a northern aspect but through staggered siting, each house has western views over the city. Number 46 is sited closest to the road; 42 the furthest.\r\n\r\nThe houses are designed on three levels, with the ground floor of each at the same level. All have Besser concrete block walls, timber framed fenestration panels, flat roofs with metal decking and overhanging eaves and strong rectilinear forms. Two of the three houses are substantially original.\r\n<h2>42 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nThe first level consists of a garage, studio and store. Level two has an external balcony running the full width of the house and along the western facade, with the entry hallway a central zone with stairway. This level originally contained three bedrooms, a laundry and a bathroom. On level three the staircase opens to an open plan reception, living and dining area; this level also contains the main kitchen and master bedroom.\r\n<h2>44 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nUnfortunately, number 44 has been extended on three occasions (1973, 1976 and 1990). The original house consisted of a garage and storeroom on the lower level. An external staircase led to the entry on the second level, which contained large living and dining areas, playroom and kitchen with full width glazing looking out to the west. The third level contained three bedrooms, a study and bathroom.\r\n<h2>46 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nOn the lower floor is a garage and storeroom. The second level entry is planned as a rectangular wing on a north-south axis. External stairs lead up to the entrance, opening to entry hall, dining, kitchen and living room facing north, the full width of the wing. The main bedroom and ensuite are also at this level. Stairs lead up to the third level, planned as a children’s wing, with a central playroom, four small bedrooms and a bathroom.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 04:36:44', '2020-10-05 04:36:44', '', 29, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/29-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

The timber-framed glazing is painted white externally, while interior finishes are low key: face concrete blockwork walls, limed ash joinery and panelling and compressed straw ceilings with exposed rafters and beams.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Manning Clark House</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(11 TASMANIA CIRCLE, FORREST )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThe Manning Clark House, at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952 for Professor and Mrs Manning Clark.\r\nThe house is typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style and Boyd’s Peninsula House Design, with its low pitched gable roof, widely projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the nearby Fenner House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery joining two wings of the house.\r\n\r\nThe house has great significance for its association with Professor Manning Clark. The efforts of the Manning Clark House\r\norganisation will ensure that the house is conserved and made available to future generations of Australians for cultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well\r\nlaid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber\r\nframed windows and metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance.\r\nEither side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south.\r\nThe walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other.\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to thestudy is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\nThe living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves.\r\nThe living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>McKeown Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(109 IRVINE STREET, WATSON)</h3>\r\n<img class="alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4.jpg" />\r\n\r\nThese two houses at 109 Irvine Street, Watson are unusual in that they were designed 30 years apart by the same architect for the same client on the same block of land. Both were designed by Enrico Taglietti and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\r\n\r\nTaglietti designed this house for the McKeown family in 1965. The plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\r\n\r\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\r\n\r\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\r\n<h1>Vasey Crescent Houses</h1>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>(42, 44 AND 46 VASEY CRESCENT, CAMPBELL )</h3>\r\n<img class="alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/vasey-cres-5.jpg" width="455" height="341" />This houses were designed by Roy Grounds of the firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd in 1960. As a result of a collaboration between the owners of each block, the three houses were designed by the same architect and built as a coordinated group. When Grounds received the commission to design the Victorian Arts Centre, management of the Vasey Crescent group of houses was taken over by Robin Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe houses are fine examples of the post-war Melbourne regional style with their long unbroken rooflines and widely projecting eaves. With their strong formal composition, large areas of glazing and open plan living areas, the houses also exhibit aspects of the post-war international style. Note the similarities with other work by Grounds in Canberra: Forrest Townhouses (1959) and 24 Cobby Street, Campbell (1963–64).\r\n\r\nThe site for the Vasey Crescent houses is on an east-west ridge running from Russell Hill, with a fall to the street. Each house has a northern aspect but through staggered siting, each house has western views over the city. Number 46 is sited closest to the road; 42 the furthest.\r\n\r\nThe houses are designed on three levels, with the ground floor of each at the same level. All have Besser concrete block walls, timber framed fenestration panels, flat roofs with metal decking and overhanging eaves and strong rectilinear forms. Two of the three houses are substantially original.\r\n<h2>42 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nThe first level consists of a garage, studio and store. Level two has an external balcony running the full width of the house and along the western facade, with the entry hallway a central zone with stairway. This level originally contained three bedrooms, a laundry and a bathroom. On level three the staircase opens to an open plan reception, living and dining area; this level also contains the main kitchen and master bedroom.\r\n<h2>44 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nUnfortunately, number 44 has been extended on three occasions (1973, 1976 and 1990). The original house consisted of a garage and storeroom on the lower level. An external staircase led to the entry on the second level, which contained large living and dining areas, playroom and kitchen with full width glazing looking out to the west. The third level contained three bedrooms, a study and bathroom.\r\n<h2>46 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nOn the lower floor is a garage and storeroom. The second level entry is planned as a rectangular wing on a north-south axis. External stairs lead up to the entrance, opening to entry hall, dining, kitchen and living room facing north, the full width of the wing. The main bedroom and ensuite are also at this level. Stairs lead up to the third level, planned as a children’s wing, with a central playroom, four small bedrooms and a bathroom.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 04:38:52', '2020-10-05 04:38:52', '', 29, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/29-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;
