The Territory is a hilly environment containing much natural bushland. The tree-clad, landscaped city itself has been described by architecture historian Jennifer Taylor as “a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_74" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-74 size-medium" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/canberra-photo-from-NAA-2-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /> Canberra - Photo from NAA[/caption]\r\n<h3>THE 1930S AND 1940S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s beginnings as a planned city established conditions that were different from Australia’s other major cities.\r\nEarly development came in fits and starts, with government indecision, World Wars and the Great Depression severely limiting the amount of public building undertaken before 1950. Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned houses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.\r\n\r\nWhat of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practising architects in Canberra up until the\r\nlate 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little apetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site.\r\nThe best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.\r\n<h3>THE 1950S</h3>\r\nThe population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra. The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra. As a result of these influences, there are some excellent examples of post-war Melbourne (Grounds and Boyd) and post-war international architecture (Sydney architects Seidler and Ancher) from this period in Canberra, some of national importance.\r\n\r\n[Canberra is] … a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects. Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960\r\nIn Experiments in Modern Living: Scientists and the National Capital Private House 1925-1970, Milton Cameron has examined how a group of scientists, brought to Canberra to take up leading roles in the establishment of national scientific institutions, commissioned private houses that rejected previous architectural styles and wholeheartedly embraced modernist ideologies and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd established an office in Canberra, located in one of the Forrest Townhouses designed by Grounds. Roy Grounds, for example, who designed the Australian Academy of Science building formed relationships here with prominent scientists such as Sir Otto Frankel, and later designed Frankel’s house in Campbell.\r\n<h3>THE 1960S</h3>\r\nWith the NCDC in full swing, and Canberra resembling a construction site, the 1960s witnessed growth rates of 10% per year and by 1970 the\r\npopulation had climbed above 140,000. The city was transformed, with the development of new satellite towns in Woden and Belconnen, the creation of Lake Burley Griffin and the commencement of national institutions in the central national area. Notable buildings completed for national and community institutions include the Academy of Science (Roy Grounds, 1958) and the National Library of Australia (Bunning and Madden, 1967). The decade saw further important examples of Melbourne regional and post-war international architecture designed and built, together with the emerging Sydney regional style and beginnings of medium density housing. The first medium density housing development sponsored by the NCDC in Swinger Hill created a sensation when it was opened for exhibition on two weekends in April 1972, attracting over 20,000 visitors.\r\n\r\nThe major developments in Australian post-war architecture are well represented in Canberra’s houses of the 1960s:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The post-war Melbourne regional architecture of Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd Examples of post-war international style houses from Harry Seidler</li>\r\n 	<li>Sydney regional architecture by Ian McKay, Allen, Jack and Cottier and Ken Woolley</li>\r\n 	<li>The organic architecture of Enrico Tagliett</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>THE 1970S AND 1980S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s high growth rate continued in the early part of the decade and large scale office development accompanied a rapid expansion of the town centres in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong. By 1976 the population had reached 203,000. The Sydney regional style became more widespread in the early part of the decade, particularly in developing bushland suburbs such as Aranda. The 1970s also saw a further increase in medium density development as the NCDC began actively promoting the idea of townhouse living.\r\n\r\nThe city of Canberra matured in the 1980s, with the population approaching 300,000 and greater diversity apparent in lifestyles, employment and recreation. The suburbs and town centre of Tuggeranong were constructed to the south, and the new town centre of Gungahlin planned in the north. Meanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage. The marked increase in the regeneration of central suburbs has provided opportunities for architects, and produced a number of interesting and award winning houses in this period. But it’s a two-edged sword: this regeneration also threatens some significant older houses with demolition and redevelopment.\r\n<h3>ABOUT THE SITE</h3>\r\nThis site tells the story of modernist residential architecture and the development of Canberra, through profiles of significant Canberra houses, architect biographies and articles about architectural styles and heritage issues. I hope that by bringing this story together online it might stimulate an interest in Canberra’s mid-twentieth century modernist heritage.\r\n\r\nThe content for the site has been drawn from citations in the Australian Institute of Architects’ (AIA) Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture (RSTCA), my own research and conversations with house owners.

During his early career he spent some time working in the United States and England and after the war he was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne. Between 1953 and 1962, Grounds was part of the Grounds, Romberg and Boyd partnership, in which time he designed the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra.\r\n\r\nThis tour will pick-up and drop-off from the Corner of Parkes Pl W and Queen Elizabeth Terrace. After the tour, participants are invited to Sunday Sessions – music by local acts, a series of large-scale graphic interventions, and an award-winning architectural pop-up wine bar, the Pop Inn.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMid-Century Modernist Bus Tour:\r\nBoyd &amp; Friends\r\n\r\nJoin renowned architecture enthusiast, Martin Miles on a bus tour around Canberra’s best architecture including mid-century modernist icons by Boyd and other architects.\r\n\r\nRobin Boyd (1919-1971), born and educated in Melbourne, was a distinguished architect, writer and social commentator and throughout the 1940s and 1950s was Australia’s leading proponent of the modern movement. Boyd held a lifelong interest in modern architecture tempered by regional concerns. His early work employed structuralist solutions to overcome what he considered to be the deficiencies of most housing of the period and he was a leading practitioner of the post-war Melbourne regional style. The suburban house was often the focus of Boyd’s efforts, both in design and writing, and he enjoyed relatively few opportunities to design major buildings.\r\n\r\nThis tour will pick-up and drop-off from the corner of Watson Street and Gould Street in Turner. After the tour, participants are invited to Sunday Sessions – music by local acts, a series of large-scale graphic interventions, and an award-winning architectural pop-up wine bar, the Pop Inn.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMid Century Modern Tour #3\r\n\r\nUse and Re-Use\r\n\r\nBack by popular demand, this year’s architecture tours will take their cue from the Design Canberra theme: geometry. The Design Canberra festival will celebrate the strong geometry present throughout our city and the ways it creates human, creative and global connections.\r\n\r\nThe tours will introduce people to architects who have used geometric forms in a variety of ways to shape spaces for people. How have the designers of these houses and buildings used geometric principles to create dwellings that comfort and inspire their occupants? From simple rectilinear forms and modular designs to complex examples using the Pythagorean spiral and hemicycle, we’ll visit some of Canberra’s most significant houses and buildings.\r\n\r\nThis tour looks at the future of mid-century design. We’ll visit mid-century houses, an embassy and a church. How are they meeting the needs of occupants today, and how are people adapting them for current and future needs?\r\n\r\nThe tours will be presented by local architecture enthusiast and author of Canberra House, Martin Miles. The tours will also feature a variety of special guests, including internationally renowned architects and planners. Please meet at the Civic Square bus stop at 8:50am. (Buses will depart and return to this location each week.)\r\n\r\nPlease note that the bus, as well as some locations, will require stair access as well as moderate walking.

Grounds was educated at Melbourne University and articled to the large architectural firm of Blackett, Forster and Craig. After winning an award from the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects (RVIA) in 1932, he travelled and worked in England and the United States for two years, gaining exposure to contemporary architectural developments.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY CAREER</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">On his return to Australia, Grounds set up in partnership with his friend Geoffrey Mewton. Together, they were largely responsible for introducing the international style to Melbourne. Grounds’s own house, Ranelagh, at Mt Eliza (1933-34) and Mewton’s Stooke House at Brighton (1934) were fine examples of the inter-war functionalist style and highly regarded by the RVIA. Grounds ended this practice in 1936 and travelled in England until 1939, when he returned to Australia and worked on defence buildings during World War II.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE IN MELBOURNE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grounds practised by himself between 1939 and 1942 and designed a series of houses and flats (including Moonbria, 1940-41) which established his reputation as one of the foremost architects in Victoria. After the war, Grounds was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at Melbourne University and lectured in design. He resumed his architectural practice and became interested in formal, geometrically based designs. A series of houses followed with the circle (Frankston, 1952), the triangle and the square (Toorak, 1953-54) as their basis.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">GROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">When Grounds, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Robin Boyd (1919-1971) formed their partnership in 1953 all were well established in Victoria. Each brought substantial work to the practice and the firm became very successful. The partnership was largely based on the three architects agreeing to work together and share commissions and profits. However, in practice, they tended to design separately within the office.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Success in a limited competition for the proposed Australian Academy of Science provided an opportunity for Grounds to undertake a major building project—his first large commission. The dome shaped, structuralist building became an icon of modern Canberra and the construction of its reinforced concrete dome was a considerable technical achievement. It won the Meritorious Architecture Award of the Canberra Area Committee of the RAIA and the Sulman Award for Architectural Merit. Grounds became a national figure as a result. The RAIA has recently nominated the Academy of Science building to the International Union of Architects’ (UIA) World Register of Significant Twentieth Century Australian Architecture. The Academy building also led to other work in Canberra, initially for the firm and later Grounds himself. Grounds opened a Canberra office in the Forrest Townhouses (1959), which he partly financed.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">In 1959 the firm was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre, with Grounds named in the contract as the architect in charge. When Boyd and Romberg were mildly critical of the preliminary designs that Grounds showed them, relations between the partners became strained. In 1962 Grounds left the partnership, taking the commission with him. He devoted the next twenty years of his life to their completion.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">RAIA GOLD MEDAL</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grounds was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1968 and knighted in the same year. In 1969 he was elected a life fellow of the RAIA.

His early work employed structuralist<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />solutions to overcome what he considered to be the deficiencies of most housing of the period and he was a leading<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />practitioner of the post-war Melbourne regional style. The suburban house was often the focus of Boyd’s efforts,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />both in design and writing, and he enjoyed relatively few opportunities to design major buildings.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY WORK</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">After the war, Boyd was articled to A and K Henderson in Melbourne and became active in architectural writing,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />editing the student newspaper Smudges. A short lived partnership followed with Kevin Pethebridge and Frank Bell<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />(1945-1947), where he designed his first houses, including his own in Camberwell. He published Victorian Modern (1947),<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />the first history of modern architecture in Victoria.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Boyd was the first Director of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Small Homes Service from 1947-1953 and<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />from 1948 was the editor of this service for The Age newspaper, where he also wrote weekly articles. The service<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />provided designs of inexpensive houses, which attempted to incorporate modern architectural aesthetics and functional<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />planning and were sold to the public for a small fee. Boyd became a household name throughout Victoria as a result of<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />this exposure. In 1952 he published Australia’s Homes, an influential study of modernist architecture in Australia.<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />In 1953 he designed ‘The Peninsula’, perhaps Australia’s first project home.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">GROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">In 1953 Boyd, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Roy Grounds (1905-1981) formed a partnership. The practice became a<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />leading Melbourne architectural firm, where the three partners produced their own designs and sometimes shared<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />supervision work when one of them was travelling. Although the original intention was to collaborate on commissions,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />they generally worked on their own designs within the partnership.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Boyd produced a series of remarkable ‘idea’ houses during this period, many quite adventurous in structure and form.<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />His second house, at South Yarra (1957) had a draped catenary curved roof. He also continued his writing, becoming<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />an international commentator on contemporary architecture. In 1956 he accepted an offer of a teaching position at<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />MIT in Boston from Walter Gropius, a friend of Boyd’s and a Director at MIT. In 1960 Boyd published Australian<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />Ugliness, a book on the built environment and Australian suburbs.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">When Roy Grounds was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre in 1959,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />relations between the partners became strained.

He is recognised as one of Australia’s leading architects of the modern movement and the first architect in Australia to fully express the principles of the Bauhaus. He designed many important residential and commercial buildings in Australia and overseas, introducing new ideas and construction techniques and making a major contribution to the architecture of Sydney. He was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1976 and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gold Medal in 1996. Seidler died on 9 March, 2006.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">BACKGROUND AND TRAINING</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">His background and training was unlike that of local architects: he had studied under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at the Harvard School of Design and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina with Joseph Albers. He also worked with Breuer at his New York practice and briefly with Oscar Niemeyer in Rio de Janeiro. Seidler decided to establish himself in Sydney in 1948 after visiting his parents, who had moved there.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY RESIDENTIAL WORK</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler’s first house was the Rose Seidler House at Turramurra (1948). The glass walled, elevated cubiform house was revolutionary and introduced the Bauhaus principles of Gropius and Breuer into Australia for the first time. Seidler continued to present these concepts to the Australian public over the following years with a series of extremely well detailed houses, executed either in the box-like form of Le Corbusier or the bi-nuclear plan of Marcel Breuer, with living and sleeping areas separated by an entry hall. Along the way many important battles were fought and won with councils over issues relating to design (the butterfly roof), planning and zoning regulations. Experimentation with different forms was made possible with the introduction of advanced structural techniques. Since the early 1960s the geometric curve has been a recurring theme in Seidler’s work, with the quadrant being a favoured form. This can be seen to good effect in the later houses detailed on Seidler’s website.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">With his apartment building projects, Seidler introduced ideas new to Sydney and Australia. Based largely on European and American apartment types, the split access, interlocking units with a divided plan, double height living rooms and mezzanine floors, took advantage of Sydney’s spectacular views from all main rooms. The Arlington Apartments at Edgecliff are a good example. The carefully composed facades of these buildings display abstract, asymmetrical, balanced patterns and are influenced by the European art movements of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">LARGER DEVELOPMENTS</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler’s office building developments in Australia and overseas are significant. In Sydney they were, in a number of instances, the first major buildings to contribute usable, public spaces back to the city, with the integrated development of office and retail space, parking and a public plaza. One of the first and most important of these was Australia Square (1961), which also saw the start of a fruitful partnership with the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi. It represented an advanced use of concrete, with the tower constructed of a poured in place concrete core with pre-cast units serving as both formwork and finish for the surrounding concrete frame.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">CANBERRA EXAMPLES</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">There are good examples of Seidler’s residential and commercial work in Canberra. His first commission outside Sydney (the Bowden House) exhibits his design philosophy of the early period. Medium density housing at Campbell is representative of his post-war international style apartment block developments, while the Lakeview townhouses are a good later example of his emphasis on the geometric curve and quadrant. The large, pre-cast concrete Barton Offices is an important office building located near the Parliamentary Triangle in Barton.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">WORKS IN CANBERRA</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Bowden House, 11 Northcote Crescent, Deakin (1951-52)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor (1956)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Canberra South Bowling Club, Austin Street, Griffith (1959)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Campbell Group Housing, Blamey Crescent, Campbell (1964)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Garran Housing, Gilmore Crescent, Garran (1968; demolished 1999)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Ethos House, Ainslie Avenue, City (1970)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Barton Offices, Kings Avenue, Barton (1973)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Lakeview, 127 Hopetoun Circuit, Yarralumla (1982)</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">OTHER NOTABLE WORKS</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Rose Seidler House, Turramurra, NSW (1948)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Rose House, Turramurra, NSW (1949)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Waks House I, Northbridge, NSW (1949-51)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Meller House, Castlecrag, NSW (1950)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Lowe House, Mosman, NSW (1950)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Williamson House, Mosman, NSW (1951)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Hutter House, Turramurra, NSW (1952)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Ithaca Gardens apartments, Elizabeth Bay, NSW (1960)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Lend Lease House, Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW (1961)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Australia Square, Sydney, NSW (1961)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Blues Point Tower apartments, North Sydney, NSW (1961)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Muller House, Port Hacking, NSW (1963)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Arlington apartments, Edgecliff, NSW (1965-66)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Harry and Penelope Seidler House, Killara, NSW (1966-67)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Gissing House, Wahroonga, NSW (1971-72)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">MLC Centre, Sydney, NSW (1972)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler Offices and Apartments, Milsons Point, NSW (1973)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Ringwood Cultural Centre, Ringwood, VIC (1978)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grosvenor Place, Sydney, NSW (1982)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Waverley Civic Centre, Waverley, VIC (1982)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Hannes House, Cammeray, NSW (1983)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Capita Centre, Sydney, NSW (1984)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Shell Headquarters, Melbourne, VIC (1985)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">QVI Office Tower, Perth, WA (1987)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Hamilton House, Vaucluse, NSW (1989)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Horizon Apartments, Darlinghurst, NSW (1990)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Meares House, Birchgrove, NSW (1994)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Gilhotra House, Hunters Hill, NSW (1995)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Berman House, Joadja, NSW (1996)</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">SOURCE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Peter Blake, Architecture for the New World: The Work of Harry Seidler, Sydney, 1973<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960, RAIA, 1990</p>', 'Harry Seidler', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'harry-seidler', '', '', '2020-10-14 12:27:22', '2020-10-14 12:27:22', '', 0, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/?page_id=56', 0, 'page', '', 0),

(58, 1, '2020-10-05 00:11:38', '2020-10-05 00:11:38', 'ENRICO TAGLIETTI\n\nEnrico Taglietti is recognised as an important architect and a leading practitioner of the late twentieth century organic style of architecture. His unique sculptural style draws upon Italian free form construction and post-war Japanese architecture. He has designed many houses, schools, churches and commercial buildings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and his projects have won numerous RAIA awards. In March 2007 Enrico was awarded Australia’s most prestigious architecture prize—the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Gold Medal for Architecture. Taglietti passed away in May 2019, aged 93.\n\nARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA\n\nEnrico Taglietti was born in 1926 in Milan, Italy and educated at the Milan Polytechnic, earning his doctorate there in 1953. Enrico came to Australia from Italy in 1955 to design an Italian promotional display for a Sydney department store. He was then invited by the Italian Government to design their embassy in Canberra, which was to be the first of his major concrete buildings. Unfortunately that commission took nearly 20 years to materialise and in the early years complete building projects were relatively scarce. During this period interior work, commissions for motels and several houses sustained the practice—three early examples being the Gibson House at 12 Scarborough Street, Red Hill (1963), the McKeown House, 109 Irvine Street, Watson (1965) and 19 Downes Place, Hughes (1965).\n\nEnrico’s early buildings used what he called a ‘calligraphy’ of elements, with long horizontal flat roofs and balconies that cast deep shadows, sloping, banded fascias and balustrades, battered walls and unpainted surfaces for texture and low maintenance. A notable example of this is the Dickson Library, his most important early building. Designed in 1964, the library is symmetrical, outlined by Enrico’s trademark deep, banded, upswept fascias. A central mezzanine and corner gardens add variation to the plan. Enrico designed a companion building for the library in 1981, the Dickson Health Centre.\n\nEXPERIMENTATION WITH CONCRETE\n\nAfter 10 years in Canberra, Enrico’s practice had established itself and began to obtain some larger commissions. This provided the opportunity to give expression to his Italian heritage through the use of concrete as a material to create striking visual and spatial effects. Some of his domestic work from this period made use of concrete to great dramatic effect: houses such as the Smith House, Sydney (1965) and the fortress-like Paterson House at 7 Juad Place, Aranda (1970).\n\nThe use of concrete in a domestic setting allowed Enrico’s houses to blend with their natural bushland setting—the house at 7 Juad Place being perhaps the best example. This union of building and site was also achieved through the use of retaining walls and fences, often in the same material, and is an ongoing feature of Enrico’s work. The effect is to extend the composition of the building into the landscape.\n\nABSTRACT AND SCULPTURAL FORMS\n\nThrough the 1970s Enrico continued to use the creation of forms and spaces to add adventure and visual interest to structures. His school projects at Latham (1971), Flynn (1972) and Giralang (1975) demonstrate this, where his central concern for the inhabitants of his buildings produced complex yet fun and engaging environments for primary-aged children. His imaginative use of abstract forms and colour in some larger buildings allowed them to achieve a monumental scale, a good example being the Australian War Memorial Annex (1979) at Mitchell.\n\nCENTRAL THEMES\n\nThere are a number of important and recurring ideas present in Enrico’s architecture.\n\nArrival. His buildings, particularly the houses, place great importance on the arrival, but where the qualities of a building are revealed subtly after moving through a space or series of spaces, much like a Japanese house. The house at Aranda is a good example, with the approach and entry not obvious from the fortress-like appearance from the street.\n\nThe central space. Most of Enrico’s houses have a large central space that serves as a social hub for the inhabitants, containing the entrance, living and cooking areas. Enrico’s philosophy is that this is a place where the public and private needs of individuals can come together.\n\nInterlocking volumes. The idea of interlocking internal volumes is central to many of Enrico’s houses. The interconnected and overlapping internal volumes create interest and spatial drama; the idea also constitutes the rejection of a single level plan.\n\nWalls and windows. Enrico’s use of battered and stepped or curved walls and window reveals to achieve a balance between privacy and human interaction—as well as to create attractive sculptural forms—is a distinctive characteristic of his architecture.\n\nDeep overhanging eaves. Enrico’s use of the deep, overhanging timber lined eaves with timber boarded fascias for shelter and protection from the harsh Australian light is one of his most recognisable elements.\n\nWalls and courtyards. Finally, Enrico has made extensive use of walled gardens and courtyards in his work. They can project from the house (Juad Place, Aranda), form the entry to it (Mijuscovic House, Waniassa) or be enclosed by it (Gibson House, Red Hill).\n\nWhat is certain is that Enrico is a true original and has made a lasting and important contribution to Canberra’s development and built environment over a period of nearly 50 years. Enrico continues to design and his Sea Residence at Lilli Pilli, NSW won an RAIA award in 1996. In March 2007 Enrico was awarded the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Gold Medal for Architecture.\n\nWORKS IN CANBERRA\n\nTown House Motel, 60 Marcus Clarke Street, Civic (1961; demolished)\nDickson Library, Antill Street, Dickson (1964)\n19 Downes Place, Hughes (1965)\nGibson House, 12 Scarborough Street, Red Hill (1965)\nMcKeown Houses, 109 Irvine Street, Watson (1965 and 1994)\nCenter Cinema, Bunda Street, Civic (1966)\nItalian Embassy, National Circuit, Deakin (1967)\nACMA Conference Centre, 26 Brisbane Avenue, Barton (1967)\n7 Juad Place, Aranda (1970)\nKillen House, 311 Majura Road (1970)\nLatham Primary School and Pre School, O’Loghlen Street, Latham (1971)\nEvans House, 62 Skinner Street, Cook (1971)\nFlynn Primary School and Pre School, Bingle Street, Flynn (1972)\nMedium Density Housing, Mockridge Crescent, Holt (1973)\nWood House, 43 Mayo Street, Weetangera (1973)\nGreen House, 78 Couvreur Street, Garran (1975)\nGiralang Primary School, Canopus Crescent, Giralang (1975)\nGentle House, 7 Niblo Place, Chapman (1977)\nApostolic Nunciature, 2 Vancouver Street, Red Hill (1977)\nAustralian War Memorial Annex, 4 Callan Street, Mitchell (1978-79)\nNitrate Film Vaults, 16 Vickers Street, Mitchell (1978)\n61 Sullivan Crescent, Wanniassa (1980)\nDickson Health Centre, Antill Street, Dickson (1981)\nGowrie Primary School and Pre School, Jeffries Street, Gowrie (1983)\nPhillips Fox Building, 54 Marcus Clarke Street, Civic (1985)\nWoden Youth Centre, Callam Street, Phillip (1988)\nReal Estate House, 16 Thesiger Court, Deakin (1989-93)\nSaudi Arabian Ambassadors Residence, 88 Brereton Street, Garran (1996)\nOTHER WORKS\n\nOsborne House, Grantham Park, Currandooley, NSW, (1961; first house in Australia)\nChurch of St Anthony’s, Marsfield, NSW (1968)\nSmith House, 25-27 Glenhope Road, West Pennant Hills, Sydney (1968-70)\nSt Kilda Library, 150 Carlisle Street, St Kilda, VIC (1969)\nDunmore Lang Apartments, 159 Herring Road, Marsfield, Sydney (1971)\nSea Residence, Lilli Pilli, NSW (1996)\n\nSOURCE\n\nK Charlton, B Jones &amp; P Favaro, The Contribution of Enrico Taglietti to Canberra’s Architecture, RAIA, 2007\nJennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960, RAIA, 1990', 'Enrico Taglietti', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'enrico-taglietti', '', '', '2020-10-09 12:32:40', '2020-10-09 12:32:40', '', 0, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/?page_id=58', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Grounds was educated at Melbourne University and articled to the large architectural firm of Blackett, Forster and Craig. After winning an award from the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects (RVIA) in 1932, he travelled and worked in England and the United States for two years, gaining exposure to contemporary architectural developments.\r\n\r\nEARLY CAREER\r\n\r\nOn his return to Australia, Grounds set up in partnership with his friend Geoffrey Mewton. Together, they were largely responsible for introducing the international style to Melbourne. Grounds’s own house, Ranelagh, at Mt Eliza (1933-34) and Mewton’s Stooke House at Brighton (1934) were fine examples of the inter-war functionalist style and highly regarded by the RVIA. Grounds ended this practice in 1936 and travelled in England until 1939, when he returned to Australia and worked on defence buildings during World War II.\r\n\r\nRESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE IN MELBOURNE\r\n\r\nGrounds practised by himself between 1939 and 1942 and designed a series of houses and flats (including Moonbria, 1940-41) which established his reputation as one of the foremost architects in Victoria. After the war, Grounds was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at Melbourne University and lectured in design. He resumed his architectural practice and became interested in formal, geometrically based designs. A series of houses followed with the circle (Frankston, 1952), the triangle and the square (Toorak, 1953-54) as their basis.\r\n\r\nGROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD\r\n\r\nWhen Grounds, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Robin Boyd (1919-1971) formed their partnership in 1953 all were well established in Victoria. Each brought substantial work to the practice and the firm became very successful. The partnership was largely based on the three architects agreeing to work together and share commissions and profits. However, in practice, they tended to design separately within the office.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\nSuccess in a limited competition for the proposed Australian Academy of Science provided an opportunity for Grounds to undertake a major building project—his first large commission. The dome shaped, structuralist building became an icon of modern Canberra and the construction of its reinforced concrete dome was a considerable technical achievement. It won the Meritorious Architecture Award of the Canberra Area Committee of the RAIA and the Sulman Award for Architectural Merit. Grounds became a national figure as a result. The RAIA has recently nominated the Academy of Science building to the International Union of Architects’ (UIA) World Register of Significant Twentieth Century Australian Architecture. The Academy building also led to other work in Canberra, initially for the firm and later Grounds himself. Grounds opened a Canberra office in the Forrest Townhouses (1959), which he partly financed.\r\n\r\nIn 1959 the firm was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre, with Grounds named in the contract as the architect in charge. When Boyd and Romberg were mildly critical of the preliminary designs that Grounds showed them, relations between the partners became strained. In 1962 Grounds left the partnership, taking the commission with him. He devoted the next twenty years of his life to their completion.\r\n\r\nRAIA GOLD MEDAL\r\n\r\nGrounds was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1968 and knighted in the same year. In 1969 he was elected a life fellow of the RAIA. Jennifer Taylor has noted that Grounds\r\n\r\ncombined rationalism and economical planning with a love of warm, natural materials\r\nJennifer Taylor\r\nHis buildings, mostly houses, blended sensitively with their sites.

His early work employed structuralist\r\nsolutions to overcome what he considered to be the deficiencies of most housing of the period and he was a leading\r\npractitioner of the post-war Melbourne regional style. The suburban house was often the focus of Boyd’s efforts,\r\nboth in design and writing, and he enjoyed relatively few opportunities to design major buildings.\r\n\r\nEARLY WORK\r\n\r\nAfter the war, Boyd was articled to A and K Henderson in Melbourne and became active in architectural writing,\r\nediting the student newspaper Smudges. A short lived partnership followed with Kevin Pethebridge and Frank Bell\r\n(1945-1947), where he designed his first houses, including his own in Camberwell. He published Victorian Modern (1947),\r\nthe first history of modern architecture in Victoria.\r\n\r\nBoyd was the first Director of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Small Homes Service from 1947-1953 and\r\nfrom 1948 was the editor of this service for The Age newspaper, where he also wrote weekly articles. The service\r\nprovided designs of inexpensive houses, which attempted to incorporate modern architectural aesthetics and functional\r\nplanning and were sold to the public for a small fee. Boyd became a household name throughout Victoria as a result of\r\nthis exposure. In 1952 he published Australia’s Homes, an influential study of modernist architecture in Australia.\r\nIn 1953 he designed ‘The Peninsula’, perhaps Australia’s first project home.\r\n\r\nGROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD\r\n\r\nIn 1953 Boyd, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Roy Grounds (1905-1981) formed a partnership. The practice became a\r\nleading Melbourne architectural firm, where the three partners produced their own designs and sometimes shared\r\nsupervision work when one of them was travelling. Although the original intention was to collaborate on commissions,\r\nthey generally worked on their own designs within the partnership.\r\n\r\nBoyd produced a series of remarkable ‘idea’ houses during this period, many quite adventurous in structure and form.\r\nHis second house, at South Yarra (1957) had a draped catenary curved roof. He also continued his writing, becoming\r\nan international commentator on contemporary architecture. In 1956 he accepted an offer of a teaching position at\r\nMIT in Boston from Walter Gropius, a friend of Boyd’s and a Director at MIT. In 1960 Boyd published Australian\r\nUgliness, a book on the built environment and Australian suburbs.\r\n\r\nWhen Roy Grounds was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre in 1959,\r\nrelations between the partners became strained. Grounds left the partnership in 1962 and took the commission with him.\r\nRomberg and Boyd continued in partnership until Boyd’s unexpected death in 1971 at the age of 52.\r\n\r\nLECTURES, BOOKS AND AWARDS\r\n\r\nIn 1967 Boyd presented the ABC’s Boyer Lectures and in 1970 published Living in Australia, a book of his later work,\r\nincluding the house at 12 Marawa Place, Aranda. He was made a Life Fellow of the RAIA and was awarded the RAIA Gold\r\nMedal in 1969.

He is recognised as one of Australia’s leading architects of the modern movement and the first architect in Australia to fully express the principles of the Bauhaus. He designed many important residential and commercial buildings in Australia and overseas, introducing new ideas and construction techniques and making a major contribution to the architecture of Sydney. He was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1976 and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gold Medal in 1996. Seidler died on 9 March, 2006.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND AND TRAINING\r\n\r\nHis background and training was unlike that of local architects: he had studied under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at the Harvard School of Design and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina with Joseph Albers. He also worked with Breuer at his New York practice and briefly with Oscar Niemeyer in Rio de Janeiro. Seidler decided to establish himself in Sydney in 1948 after visiting his parents, who had moved there.\r\n\r\nEARLY RESIDENTIAL WORK\r\n\r\nSeidler’s first house was the Rose Seidler House at Turramurra (1948). The glass walled, elevated cubiform house was revolutionary and introduced the Bauhaus principles of Gropius and Breuer into Australia for the first time. Seidler continued to present these concepts to the Australian public over the following years with a series of extremely well detailed houses, executed either in the box-like form of Le Corbusier or the bi-nuclear plan of Marcel Breuer, with living and sleeping areas separated by an entry hall. Along the way many important battles were fought and won with councils over issues relating to design (the butterfly roof), planning and zoning regulations. Experimentation with different forms was made possible with the introduction of advanced structural techniques. Since the early 1960s the geometric curve has been a recurring theme in Seidler’s work, with the quadrant being a favoured form. This can be seen to good effect in the later houses detailed on Seidler’s website.\r\n\r\nWith his apartment building projects, Seidler introduced ideas new to Sydney and Australia. Based largely on European and American apartment types, the split access, interlocking units with a divided plan, double height living rooms and mezzanine floors, took advantage of Sydney’s spectacular views from all main rooms. The Arlington Apartments at Edgecliff are a good example. The carefully composed facades of these buildings display abstract, asymmetrical, balanced patterns and are influenced by the European art movements of the 1920s and 1930s.\r\n\r\nLARGER DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\nSeidler’s office building developments in Australia and overseas are significant. In Sydney they were, in a number of instances, the first major buildings to contribute usable, public spaces back to the city, with the integrated development of office and retail space, parking and a public plaza. One of the first and most important of these was Australia Square (1961), which also saw the start of a fruitful partnership with the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi. It represented an advanced use of concrete, with the tower constructed of a poured in place concrete core with pre-cast units serving as both formwork and finish for the surrounding concrete frame.\r\n\r\nCANBERRA EXAMPLES\r\n\r\nThere are good examples of Seidler’s residential and commercial work in Canberra. His first commission outside Sydney (the Bowden House) exhibits his design philosophy of the early period. Medium density housing at Campbell is representative of his post-war international style apartment block developments, while the Lakeview townhouses are a good later example of his emphasis on the geometric curve and quadrant. The large, pre-cast concrete Barton Offices is an important office building located near the Parliamentary Triangle in Barton.\r\n\r\nWORKS IN CANBERRA\r\n\r\nBowden House, 11 Northcote Crescent, Deakin (1951-52)\r\n12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor (1956)\r\nCanberra South Bowling Club, Austin Street, Griffith (1959)\r\nCampbell Group Housing, Blamey Crescent, Campbell (1964)\r\nGarran Housing, Gilmore Crescent, Garran (1968; demolished 1999)\r\nEthos House, Ainslie Avenue, City (1970)\r\nBarton Offices, Kings Avenue, Barton (1973)\r\nLakeview, 127 Hopetoun Circuit, Yarralumla (1982)\r\n\r\nOTHER NOTABLE WORKS\r\n\r\nRose Seidler House, Turramurra, NSW (1948)\r\nRose House, Turramurra, NSW (1949)\r\nWaks House I, Northbridge, NSW (1949-51)\r\nMeller House, Castlecrag, NSW (1950)\r\nLowe House, Mosman, NSW (1950)\r\nWilliamson House, Mosman, NSW (1951)\r\nHutter House, Turramurra, NSW (1952)\r\nIthaca Gardens apartments, Elizabeth Bay, NSW (1960)\r\nLend Lease House, Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW (1961)\r\nAustralia Square, Sydney, NSW (1961)\r\nBlues Point Tower apartments, North Sydney, NSW (1961)\r\nMuller House, Port Hacking, NSW (1963)\r\nArlington apartments, Edgecliff, NSW (1965-66)\r\nHarry and Penelope Seidler House, Killara, NSW (1966-67)\r\nGissing House, Wahroonga, NSW (1971-72)\r\nMLC Centre, Sydney, NSW (1972)\r\nSeidler Offices and Apartments, Milsons Point, NSW (1973)\r\nRingwood Cultural Centre, Ringwood, VIC (1978)\r\nGrosvenor Place, Sydney, NSW (1982)\r\nWaverley Civic Centre, Waverley, VIC (1982)\r\nHannes House, Cammeray, NSW (1983)\r\nCapita Centre, Sydney, NSW (1984)\r\nShell Headquarters, Melbourne, VIC (1985)\r\nQVI Office Tower, Perth, WA (1987)\r\nHamilton House, Vaucluse, NSW (1989)\r\nHorizon Apartments, Darlinghurst, NSW (1990)\r\nMeares House, Birchgrove, NSW (1994)\r\nGilhotra House, Hunters Hill, NSW (1995)\r\nBerman House, Joadja, NSW (1996)\r\n\r\nSOURCE\r\n\r\nPeter Blake, Architecture for the New World: The Work of Harry Seidler, Sydney, 1973\r\nJennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960, RAIA, 1990', 'Harry Seidler', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '56-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-05 08:39:55', '2020-10-05 08:39:55', '', 56, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/05/56-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(70, 1, '2020-10-05 08:40:39', '2020-10-05 08:40:39', 'ENRICO TAGLIETTI\r\n\r\nEnrico Taglietti is recognised as an important architect and a leading practitioner of the late twentieth century organic style of architecture. His unique sculptural style draws upon Italian free form construction and post-war Japanese architecture. He has designed many houses, schools, churches and commercial buildings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and his projects have won numerous RAIA awards. In March 2007 Enrico was awarded Australia’s most prestigious architecture prize—the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Gold Medal for Architecture. Taglietti passed away in May 2019, aged 93.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nEnrico Taglietti was born in 1926 in Milan, Italy and educated at the Milan Polytechnic, earning his doctorate there in 1953. Enrico came to Australia from Italy in 1955 to design an Italian promotional display for a Sydney department store. He was then invited by the Italian Government to design their embassy in Canberra, which was to be the first of his major concrete buildings. Unfortunately that commission took nearly 20 years to materialise and in the early years complete building projects were relatively scarce. During this period interior work, commissions for motels and several houses sustained the practice—three early examples being the Gibson House at 12 Scarborough Street, Red Hill (1963), the McKeown House, 109 Irvine Street, Watson (1965) and 19 Downes Place, Hughes (1965).\r\n\r\nEnrico’s early buildings used what he called a ‘calligraphy’ of elements, with long horizontal flat roofs and balconies that cast deep shadows, sloping, banded fascias and balustrades, battered walls and unpainted surfaces for texture and low maintenance. A notable example of this is the Dickson Library, his most important early building. Designed in 1964, the library is symmetrical, outlined by Enrico’s trademark deep, banded, upswept fascias. A central mezzanine and corner gardens add variation to the plan. Enrico designed a companion building for the library in 1981, the Dickson Health Centre.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTATION WITH CONCRETE\r\n\r\nAfter 10 years in Canberra, Enrico’s practice had established itself and began to obtain some larger commissions. This provided the opportunity to give expression to his Italian heritage through the use of concrete as a material to create striking visual and spatial effects. Some of his domestic work from this period made use of concrete to great dramatic effect: houses such as the Smith House, Sydney (1965) and the fortress-like Paterson House at 7 Juad Place, Aranda (1970).\r\n\r\nThe use of concrete in a domestic setting allowed Enrico’s houses to blend with their natural bushland setting—the house at 7 Juad Place being perhaps the best example. This union of building and site was also achieved through the use of retaining walls and fences, often in the same material, and is an ongoing feature of Enrico’s work. The effect is to extend the composition of the building into the landscape.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT AND SCULPTURAL FORMS\r\n\r\nThrough the 1970s Enrico continued to use the creation of forms and spaces to add adventure and visual interest to structures. His school projects at Latham (1971), Flynn (1972) and Giralang (1975) demonstrate this, where his central concern for the inhabitants of his buildings produced complex yet fun and engaging environments for primary-aged children. His imaginative use of abstract forms and colour in some larger buildings allowed them to achieve a monumental scale, a good example being the Australian War Memorial Annex (1979) at Mitchell.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL THEMES\r\n\r\nThere are a number of important and recurring ideas present in Enrico’s architecture.\r\n\r\nArrival. His buildings, particularly the houses, place great importance on the arrival, but where the qualities of a building are revealed subtly after moving through a space or series of spaces, much like a Japanese house. The house at Aranda is a good example, with the approach and entry not obvious from the fortress-like appearance from the street.\r\n\r\nThe central space. Most of Enrico’s houses have a large central space that serves as a social hub for the inhabitants, containing the entrance, living and cooking areas. Enrico’s philosophy is that this is a place where the public and private needs of individuals can come together.\r\n\r\nInterlocking volumes. The idea of interlocking internal volumes is central to many of Enrico’s houses. The interconnected and overlapping internal volumes create interest and spatial drama; the idea also constitutes the rejection of a single level plan.\r\n\r\nWalls and windows. Enrico’s use of battered and stepped or curved walls and window reveals to achieve a balance between privacy and human interaction—as well as to create attractive sculptural forms—is a distinctive characteristic of his architecture.\r\n\r\nDeep overhanging eaves. Enrico’s use of the deep, overhanging timber lined eaves with timber boarded fascias for shelter and protection from the harsh Australian light is one of his most recognisable elements.\r\n\r\nWalls and courtyards. Finally, Enrico has made extensive use of walled gardens and courtyards in his work.

The Territory is a hilly environment containing much natural bushland. The tree-clad, landscaped city itself has been described by architecture historian Jennifer Taylor as “a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_74" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-74 size-medium" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/canberra-photo-from-NAA-2-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" /> Canberra - Photo from NAA[/caption]\r\n<h3>THE 1930S AND 1940S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s beginnings as a planned city established conditions that were different from Australia’s other major cities.\r\nEarly development came in fits and starts, with government indecision, World Wars and the Great Depression severely limiting the amount of public building undertaken before 1950. Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned houses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.\r\n\r\nWhat of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practising architects in Canberra up until the\r\nlate 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little apetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site.\r\nThe best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.\r\n<h3>THE 1950S</h3>\r\nThe population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra. The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra. As a result of these influences, there are some excellent examples of post-war Melbourne (Grounds and Boyd) and post-war international architecture (Sydney architects Seidler and Ancher) from this period in Canberra, some of national importance.\r\n\r\n[Canberra is] … a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects. Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960\r\nIn Experiments in Modern Living: Scientists and the National Capital Private House 1925-1970, Milton Cameron has examined how a group of scientists, brought to Canberra to take up leading roles in the establishment of national scientific institutions, commissioned private houses that rejected previous architectural styles and wholeheartedly embraced modernist ideologies and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd established an office in Canberra, located in one of the Forrest Townhouses designed by Grounds. Roy Grounds, for example, who designed the Australian Academy of Science building formed relationships here with prominent scientists such as Sir Otto Frankel, and later designed Frankel’s house in Campbell.\r\n<h3>THE 1960S</h3>\r\nWith the NCDC in full swing, and Canberra resembling a construction site, the 1960s witnessed growth rates of 10% per year and by 1970 the\r\npopulation had climbed above 140,000. The city was transformed, with the development of new satellite towns in Woden and Belconnen, the creation of Lake Burley Griffin and the commencement of national institutions in the central national area. Notable buildings completed for national and community institutions include the Academy of Science (Roy Grounds, 1958) and the National Library of Australia (Bunning and Madden, 1967). The decade saw further important examples of Melbourne regional and post-war international architecture designed and built, together with the emerging Sydney regional style and beginnings of medium density housing. The first medium density housing development sponsored by the NCDC in Swinger Hill created a sensation when it was opened for exhibition on two weekends in April 1972, attracting over 20,000 visitors.\r\n\r\nThe major developments in Australian post-war architecture are well represented in Canberra’s houses of the 1960s:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The post-war Melbourne regional architecture of Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd Examples of post-war international style houses from Harry Seidler</li>\r\n 	<li>Sydney regional architecture by Ian McKay, Allen, Jack and Cottier and Ken Woolley</li>\r\n 	<li>The organic architecture of Enrico Tagliett</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>THE 1970S AND 1980S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s high growth rate continued in the early part of the decade and large scale office development accompanied a rapid expansion of the town centres in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong. By 1976 the population had reached 203,000. The Sydney regional style became more widespread in the early part of the decade, particularly in developing bushland suburbs such as Aranda. The 1970s also saw a further increase in medium density development as the NCDC began actively promoting the idea of townhouse living.\r\n\r\nThe city of Canberra matured in the 1980s, with the population approaching 300,000 and greater diversity apparent in lifestyles, employment and recreation. The suburbs and town centre of Tuggeranong were constructed to the south, and the new town centre of Gungahlin planned in the north. Meanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage. The marked increase in the regeneration of central suburbs has provided opportunities for architects, and produced a number of interesting and award winning houses in this period. But it’s a two-edged sword: this regeneration also threatens some significant older houses with demolition and redevelopment.\r\n<h3>ABOUT THE SITE</h3>\r\nThis site tells the story of modernist residential architecture and the development of Canberra, through profiles of significant Canberra houses, architect biographies and articles about architectural styles and heritage issues. I hope that by bringing this story together online it might stimulate an interest in Canberra’s mid-twentieth century modernist heritage.\r\n\r\nThe content for the site has been drawn from citations in the Australian Institute of Architects’ (AIA) Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture (RSTCA), my own research and conversations with house owners.

The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape.

Both were designed by <a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/enrico-taglietti/">Enrico Taglietti</a> and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\n<h2>MCKEOWN HOUSE I</h2>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-99 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeownhouse-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200">\n\nThe plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\n\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\n\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\n<h2>MCKEOWN HOUSE II</h2>\n<img class=" wp-image-119 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4-1-256x300.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="295">In 1993 Taglietti was engaged by the original owner to design an additional home on the block behind the original house. The new two-storey design contrasts markedly with the earlier horizontally proportioned dwelling. While the walls of both are white, the emphasis is on vertical lines in the proportions, with a steeply pitched roof and an adjacent tower-like element.\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'McKeown houses', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'mckeown-houses', '', '', '2020-10-07 10:30:47', '2020-10-07 10:30:47', '', 0, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/?page_id=84', 0, 'page', '', 0),

As a result of a collaboration between the owners of each block, the three houses were designed by the same architect and built as a coordinated group.\n\nThe site for the Vasey Crescent houses is on an east-west ridge running from Russell Hill, with a fall to the street. Each house has a northern aspect but through staggered siting, each house has western views over the city. Number 46 is sited closest to the road; 42 the furthest.\n\nThe houses are designed on three levels, with the ground floor of each at the same level. All have Besser concrete block walls, timber framed fenestration panels, flat roofs with metal decking and overhanging eaves and strong rectilinear forms. Two of the three houses are substantially original.\n<h2>42 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\nThe first level consists of a garage, studio and store. Level two has an external balcony running the full width of the house and along the western facade, with the entry hallway a central zone with stairway. This level originally contained three bedrooms, a laundry and a bathroom. On level three the staircase opens to an open plan reception, living and dining area; this level also contains the main kitchen and master bedroom.\n<h2>44 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\nUnfortunately, number 44 has been extended on three occasions (1973, 1976 and 1990). The original house consisted of a garage and storeroom on the lower level. An external staircase led to the entry on the second level, which contained large living and dining areas, playroom and kitchen with full width glazing looking out to the west. The third level contained three bedrooms, a study and bathroom.\n<h2>46 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\nOn the lower floor is a garage and storeroom. The second level entry is planned as a rectangular wing on a north-south axis. External stairs lead up to the entrance, opening to entry hall, dining, kitchen and living room facing north, the full width of the wing. The main bedroom and ensuite are also at this level. Stairs lead up to the third level, planned as a children’s wing, with a central playroom, four small bedrooms and a bathroom.\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'Vasey Crescent houses', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'vasey-crescent-houses', '', '', '2020-10-07 10:29:53', '2020-10-07 10:29:53', '', 0, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/?page_id=86', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.\r\n\r\nThe original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney.

Similar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to the study is by a very steep flight of steps.

The living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n\r\nOnly minor alterations have been made to house.

The house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well laid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber framed windows and metal deck roof.<img class="size-medium wp-image-113 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance. Either side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south. The walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other. Similar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to the study is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-114 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-7-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />The living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves. The living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n\r\nOnly minor alterations have been made to house. A pergola was added to extend the sunshade over the north facing windows of the study and a carport was built on to the side of the house near the entry area.

The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\r\n\r\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.\r\n\r\nThe split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.<img class=" wp-image-102 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bowden-house-1-photo-by-max-dupain-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="412" />\r\n\r\nThe house has been modified and extended twice: the first time in 1957–60 by Seidler and the second time in 1978 by a local architect.

The original design aesthetic was maintained with matching wall finishes and roofing, but the upper level planning themes were largely changed by this extension.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room.

The house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well laid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber framed windows and metal deck roof.<img class="size-medium wp-image-113 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />\r\n\r\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance. Either side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south. The walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other. Similar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).\r\n\r\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to the study is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\r\n\r\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-114 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-7-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />The living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves. The living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\r\n\r\nOnly minor alterations have been made to house. A pergola was added to extend the sunshade over the north facing windows of the study and a carport was built on to the side of the house near the entry area.

Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\r\n\r\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\r\n\r\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\r\n<h2>MCKEOWN HOUSE II</h2>\r\n<img class=" wp-image-119 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4-1-256x300.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="295" />In 1993 Taglietti was engaged by the original owner to design an additional home on the block behind the original house. The new two-storey design contrasts markedly with the earlier horizontally proportioned dwelling. While the walls of both are white, the emphasis is on vertical lines in the proportions, with a steeply pitched roof and an adjacent tower-like element.\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'McKeown houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '84-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-07 08:55:59', '2020-10-07 08:55:59', '', 84, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/07/84-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

As a result of a collaboration between the owners of each block, the three houses were designed by the same architect and built as a coordinated group.\r\n\r\nThe site for the Vasey Crescent houses is on an east-west ridge running from Russell Hill, with a fall to the street. Each house has a northern aspect but through staggered siting, each house has western views over the city. Number 46 is sited closest to the road; 42 the furthest.\r\n\r\nThe houses are designed on three levels, with the ground floor of each at the same level. All have Besser concrete block walls, timber framed fenestration panels, flat roofs with metal decking and overhanging eaves and strong rectilinear forms. Two of the three houses are substantially original.\r\n<h2>42 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nThe first level consists of a garage, studio and store. Level two has an external balcony running the full width of the house and along the western facade, with the entry hallway a central zone with stairway. This level originally contained three bedrooms, a laundry and a bathroom. On level three the staircase opens to an open plan reception, living and dining area; this level also contains the main kitchen and master bedroom.\r\n<h2>44 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nUnfortunately, number 44 has been extended on three occasions (1973, 1976 and 1990). The original house consisted of a garage and storeroom on the lower level. An external staircase led to the entry on the second level, which contained large living and dining areas, playroom and kitchen with full width glazing looking out to the west. The third level contained three bedrooms, a study and bathroom.\r\n<h2>46 VASEY CRESCENT</h2>\r\nOn the lower floor is a garage and storeroom. The second level entry is planned as a rectangular wing on a north-south axis. External stairs lead up to the entrance, opening to entry hall, dining, kitchen and living room facing north, the full width of the wing. The main bedroom and ensuite are also at this level. Stairs lead up to the third level, planned as a children’s wing, with a central playroom, four small bedrooms and a bathroom.\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'Vasey Crescent houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '86-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-07 08:56:20', '2020-10-07 08:56:20', '', 86, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/07/86-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned houses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practising architects in Canberra up until the<br>late 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little apetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Incidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site.<br>The best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->\n<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"right"} -->\n<h2 class="has-text-align-right">THE 1950S</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:columns -->\n<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column -->\n<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra.<br>The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra.

Meanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage.

Canberra was little more than a country town during the 1930s, with a population of around 10,000. In 1941 there were as few as 400 privately owned houses, with the vast majority of housing construction government driven.\r\n\r\nWhat of modernism in Canberra during this period? The ideas of mainstream modernism came slowly to Australia and there was little private building activity in Canberra during this period. There were probably only two privately practising architects in Canberra up until the\r\nlate 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little apetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site.\r\nThe best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.\r\n<h3>THE 1950S</h3>\r\nThe population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra. The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra. As a result of these influences, there are some excellent examples of post-war Melbourne (Grounds and Boyd) and post-war international architecture (Sydney architects Seidler and Ancher) from this period in Canberra, some of national importance.\r\n\r\n[Canberra is] … a vast garden containing buildings as individual objects. Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960\r\nIn Experiments in Modern Living: Scientists and the National Capital Private House 1925-1970, Milton Cameron has examined how a group of scientists, brought to Canberra to take up leading roles in the establishment of national scientific institutions, commissioned private houses that rejected previous architectural styles and wholeheartedly embraced modernist ideologies and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe firm Grounds, Romberg and Boyd established an office in Canberra, located in one of the Forrest Townhouses designed by Grounds. Roy Grounds, for example, who designed the Australian Academy of Science building formed relationships here with prominent scientists such as Sir Otto Frankel, and later designed Frankel’s house in Campbell.\r\n<h3>THE 1960S</h3>\r\nWith the NCDC in full swing, and Canberra resembling a construction site, the 1960s witnessed growth rates of 10% per year and by 1970 the\r\npopulation had climbed above 140,000. The city was transformed, with the development of new satellite towns in Woden and Belconnen, the creation of Lake Burley Griffin and the commencement of national institutions in the central national area. Notable buildings completed for national and community institutions include the Academy of Science (Roy Grounds, 1958) and the National Library of Australia (Bunning and Madden, 1967). The decade saw further important examples of Melbourne regional and post-war international architecture designed and built, together with the emerging Sydney regional style and beginnings of medium density housing. The first medium density housing development sponsored by the NCDC in Swinger Hill created a sensation when it was opened for exhibition on two weekends in April 1972, attracting over 20,000 visitors.\r\n\r\nThe major developments in Australian post-war architecture are well represented in Canberra’s houses of the 1960s:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The post-war Melbourne regional architecture of Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd Examples of post-war international style houses from Harry Seidler</li>\r\n 	<li>Sydney regional architecture by Ian McKay, Allen, Jack and Cottier and Ken Woolley</li>\r\n 	<li>The organic architecture of Enrico Tagliett</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>THE 1970S AND 1980S</h3>\r\nCanberra’s high growth rate continued in the early part of the decade and large scale office development accompanied a rapid expansion of the town centres in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong. By 1976 the population had reached 203,000. The Sydney regional style became more widespread in the early part of the decade, particularly in developing bushland suburbs such as Aranda. The 1970s also saw a further increase in medium density development as the NCDC began actively promoting the idea of townhouse living.\r\n\r\nThe city of Canberra matured in the 1980s, with the population approaching 300,000 and greater diversity apparent in lifestyles, employment and recreation. The suburbs and town centre of Tuggeranong were constructed to the south, and the new town centre of Gungahlin planned in the north. Meanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage. The marked increase in the regeneration of central suburbs has provided opportunities for architects, and produced a number of interesting and award winning houses in this period. But it’s a two-edged sword: this regeneration also threatens some significant older houses with demolition and redevelopment.\r\n<h3>ABOUT THE SITE</h3>\r\nThis site tells the story of modernist residential architecture and the development of Canberra, through profiles of significant Canberra houses, architect biographies and articles about architectural styles and heritage issues.

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.\n\n<img class=" wp-image-92 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bowden-house-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="249">The original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.\n\nThe entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.\n\nThe split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.\n\nThe upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.\n\nThe upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.<img class=" wp-image-102 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bowden-house-1-photo-by-max-dupain-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="412">\n\nThe house has been modified and extended twice: the first time in 1957–60 by Seidler and the second time in 1978 by a local architect. The Seidler work added two bedrooms to the north east, a new laundry and an extension of the kitchen and dining room into the original laundry space and courtyard. The original design aesthetic was maintained with matching wall finishes and roofing, but the upper level planning themes were largely changed by this extension.\n\nUnfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room. The cantilevered balcony off the main bedroom has also been enclosed, which has changed the appearance of the western facade. This was an important design feature, being an expression of the internal spaces, structure and architectural style.\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>\n&nbsp;', 'Bowden House', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '76-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-07 10:23:20', '2020-10-07 10:23:20', '', 76, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/07/76-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Both were designed by <a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/enrico-taglietti/">Enrico Taglietti</a> and are excellent examples of his sculptural organic style of architecture.\n<h2>MCKEOWN HOUSE I</h2>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-99 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeownhouse-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200">\n\nThe plan was for two staggered squares, with one for living areas and the other for sleeping. Viewed from the street, all that is seen are wedge-shaped, off-white rendered walls with timber framed, wedge-shaped corner windows. These corner windows came to be a trademark feature in Taglietti’s later work and add to the sculptural form of the house.\n\nThe roof is a flat, metal-decked butterfly arrangement with a striking cantilevered, concrete gutter protruding over a rectangular pond. The gutter directs rainwater from the roof into the pool below—the beginning of Taglietti’s enthusiasm for rainwater spouts. This gutter separates the two modular designed sections of the house and forms the roof over the central hall.\n\nThe blank wall facing the street was extended as a garden wall to screen the approach to the front door and the garage, which was intended to be a future third bedroom. The south walls to the rear have large glazed openings to the master bedroom and the open-plan living and dining area.\n<h2>MCKEOWN HOUSE II</h2>\n<img class=" wp-image-119 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mckeon-4-1-256x300.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="295">In 1993 Taglietti was engaged by the original owner to design an additional home on the block behind the original house. The new two-storey design contrasts markedly with the earlier horizontally proportioned dwelling. While the walls of both are white, the emphasis is on vertical lines in the proportions, with a steeply pitched roof and an adjacent tower-like element.\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'McKeown houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '84-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-07 10:30:47', '2020-10-07 10:30:47', '', 84, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/07/84-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the north aspect and outlook to the well laid out garden. The house is of simple masonry construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber framed windows and metal deck roof.<img class="size-medium wp-image-113 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-3-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300">\n\nTwo separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a glass walled passage and entrance. Either side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing north and the other (the main entrance) facing south. The walls of the south courtyard are brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the other. Similar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).\n\nPositioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements for an isolated work area. Access to the study is by a very steep flight of steps. The study contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element of the house.\n\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-114 alignleft" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manning-clark-7-photo-copyright-anthiny-basheer-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300">The living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows shielded by white louvred eaves. The living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted grey.\n\nOnly minor alterations have been made to house. A pergola was added to extend the sunshade over the north facing windows of the study and a carport was built on to the side of the house near the entry area. The house is in excellent condition.\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'Manning Clark house', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '82-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-07 10:31:39', '2020-10-07 10:31:39', '', 82, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/07/82-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The courtyard walls facing Dominion Circuit did not comply with local NCDC guidelines when constructed and were demolished. They were rebuilt at a later date on condition that they be hidden by a planting of bamboo, which remains to this day.\n\nThe townhouses have a two storey height living space, which is screened by sliding doors from the dining, kitchen and entry area. Above this is a gallery with a built in desk, which overlooks the living area. Behind the gallery are two bedrooms, a dressing room and a bathroom. The single level courtyard house has a large open living area facing north and opening to a courtyard.<img class=" wp-image-97 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Forrest-town-houses-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="363" height="242">\n\nThe townhouses are constructed with load bearing concrete blocks, a concrete slab to the ground floor and timber and steel framing to the upper floor and flat metal deck roof. The timber-framed glazing is painted white externally, while interior finishes are low key: face concrete blockwork walls, limed ash joinery and panelling and compressed straw ceilings with exposed rafters and beams.\n\nThe Forrest Townhouses were built by Civil and Civic (who also built 42 Vasey Crescent).\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'Forrest town houses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '80-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-07 10:32:15', '2020-10-07 10:32:15', '', 80, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/07/80-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.\n\nThe construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.<img class=" wp-image-95 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fennerhouse2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="241">\n\nIn 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house.

The building consists of two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.\n\nThe construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long, unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.<img class=" wp-image-95 alignright" src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fennerhouse2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="241" />\n\nIn 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of being as close as possible in external appearance to the original part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear, the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper than the original rear wing.\n<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/houses/">Back</a></p>', 'Fenner house', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '78-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-08 21:52:13', '2020-10-08 21:52:13', '', 78, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/08/78-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Grounds was educated at Melbourne University and articled to the large architectural firm of Blackett, Forster and Craig. After winning an award from the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects (RVIA) in 1932, he travelled and worked in England and the United States for two years, gaining exposure to contemporary architectural developments.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY CAREER</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">On his return to Australia, Grounds set up in partnership with his friend Geoffrey Mewton. Together, they were largely responsible for introducing the international style to Melbourne. Grounds’s own house, Ranelagh, at Mt Eliza (1933-34) and Mewton’s Stooke House at Brighton (1934) were fine examples of the inter-war functionalist style and highly regarded by the RVIA. Grounds ended this practice in 1936 and travelled in England until 1939, when he returned to Australia and worked on defence buildings during World War II.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE IN MELBOURNE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grounds practised by himself between 1939 and 1942 and designed a series of houses and flats (including Moonbria, 1940-41) which established his reputation as one of the foremost architects in Victoria. After the war, Grounds was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at Melbourne University and lectured in design. He resumed his architectural practice and became interested in formal, geometrically based designs. A series of houses followed with the circle (Frankston, 1952), the triangle and the square (Toorak, 1953-54) as their basis.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">GROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">When Grounds, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Robin Boyd (1919-1971) formed their partnership in 1953 all were well established in Victoria. Each brought substantial work to the practice and the firm became very successful. The partnership was largely based on the three architects agreeing to work together and share commissions and profits. However, in practice, they tended to design separately within the office.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Success in a limited competition for the proposed Australian Academy of Science provided an opportunity for Grounds to undertake a major building project—his first large commission. The dome shaped, structuralist building became an icon of modern Canberra and the construction of its reinforced concrete dome was a considerable technical achievement. It won the Meritorious Architecture Award of the Canberra Area Committee of the RAIA and the Sulman Award for Architectural Merit. Grounds became a national figure as a result. The RAIA has recently nominated the Academy of Science building to the International Union of Architects’ (UIA) World Register of Significant Twentieth Century Australian Architecture. The Academy building also led to other work in Canberra, initially for the firm and later Grounds himself. Grounds opened a Canberra office in the Forrest Townhouses (1959), which he partly financed.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">In 1959 the firm was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre, with Grounds named in the contract as the architect in charge. When Boyd and Romberg were mildly critical of the preliminary designs that Grounds showed them, relations between the partners became strained. In 1962 Grounds left the partnership, taking the commission with him. He devoted the next twenty years of his life to their completion.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">RAIA GOLD MEDAL</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grounds was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1968 and knighted in the same year.

Grounds was educated at Melbourne University and articled to the large architectural firm of Blackett, Forster and Craig. After winning an award from the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects (RVIA) in 1932, he travelled and worked in England and the United States for two years, gaining exposure to contemporary architectural developments.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY CAREER</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">On his return to Australia, Grounds set up in partnership with his friend Geoffrey Mewton. Together, they were largely responsible for introducing the international style to Melbourne. Grounds’s own house, Ranelagh, at Mt Eliza (1933-34) and Mewton’s Stooke House at Brighton (1934) were fine examples of the inter-war functionalist style and highly regarded by the RVIA. Grounds ended this practice in 1936 and travelled in England until 1939, when he returned to Australia and worked on defence buildings during World War II.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE IN MELBOURNE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grounds practised by himself between 1939 and 1942 and designed a series of houses and flats (including Moonbria, 1940-41) which established his reputation as one of the foremost architects in Victoria. After the war, Grounds was involved in setting up the curriculum for the School of Architecture at Melbourne University and lectured in design. He resumed his architectural practice and became interested in formal, geometrically based designs. A series of houses followed with the circle (Frankston, 1952), the triangle and the square (Toorak, 1953-54) as their basis.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">GROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">When Grounds, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Robin Boyd (1919-1971) formed their partnership in 1953 all were well established in Victoria. Each brought substantial work to the practice and the firm became very successful. The partnership was largely based on the three architects agreeing to work together and share commissions and profits. However, in practice, they tended to design separately within the office.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Success in a limited competition for the proposed Australian Academy of Science provided an opportunity for Grounds to undertake a major building project—his first large commission. The dome shaped, structuralist building became an icon of modern Canberra and the construction of its reinforced concrete dome was a considerable technical achievement. It won the Meritorious Architecture Award of the Canberra Area Committee of the RAIA and the Sulman Award for Architectural Merit. Grounds became a national figure as a result. The RAIA has recently nominated the Academy of Science building to the International Union of Architects’ (UIA) World Register of Significant Twentieth Century Australian Architecture. The Academy building also led to other work in Canberra, initially for the firm and later Grounds himself. Grounds opened a Canberra office in the Forrest Townhouses (1959), which he partly financed.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">In 1959 the firm was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre, with Grounds named in the contract as the architect in charge. When Boyd and Romberg were mildly critical of the preliminary designs that Grounds showed them, relations between the partners became strained. In 1962 Grounds left the partnership, taking the commission with him. He devoted the next twenty years of his life to their completion.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">RAIA GOLD MEDAL</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grounds was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1968 and knighted in the same year. In 1969 he was elected a life fellow of the RAIA.

His early work employed structuralist<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />solutions to overcome what he considered to be the deficiencies of most housing of the period and he was a leading<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />practitioner of the post-war Melbourne regional style. The suburban house was often the focus of Boyd’s efforts,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />both in design and writing, and he enjoyed relatively few opportunities to design major buildings.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY WORK</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">After the war, Boyd was articled to A and K Henderson in Melbourne and became active in architectural writing,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />editing the student newspaper Smudges. A short lived partnership followed with Kevin Pethebridge and Frank Bell<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />(1945-1947), where he designed his first houses, including his own in Camberwell. He published Victorian Modern (1947),<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />the first history of modern architecture in Victoria.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Boyd was the first Director of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Small Homes Service from 1947-1953 and<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />from 1948 was the editor of this service for The Age newspaper, where he also wrote weekly articles. The service<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />provided designs of inexpensive houses, which attempted to incorporate modern architectural aesthetics and functional<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />planning and were sold to the public for a small fee. Boyd became a household name throughout Victoria as a result of<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />this exposure. In 1952 he published Australia’s Homes, an influential study of modernist architecture in Australia.<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />In 1953 he designed ‘The Peninsula’, perhaps Australia’s first project home.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">GROUNDS, ROMBERG AND BOYD</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">In 1953 Boyd, Frederick Romberg (1910-1992) and Roy Grounds (1905-1981) formed a partnership. The practice became a<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />leading Melbourne architectural firm, where the three partners produced their own designs and sometimes shared<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />supervision work when one of them was travelling. Although the original intention was to collaborate on commissions,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />they generally worked on their own designs within the partnership.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Boyd produced a series of remarkable ‘idea’ houses during this period, many quite adventurous in structure and form.<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />His second house, at South Yarra (1957) had a draped catenary curved roof. He also continued his writing, becoming<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />an international commentator on contemporary architecture. In 1956 he accepted an offer of a teaching position at<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />MIT in Boston from Walter Gropius, a friend of Boyd’s and a Director at MIT. In 1960 Boyd published Australian<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />Ugliness, a book on the built environment and Australian suburbs.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">When Roy Grounds was awarded the commission to design the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre in 1959,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />relations between the partners became strained. Grounds left the partnership in 1962 and took the commission with him.<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />Romberg and Boyd continued in partnership until Boyd’s unexpected death in 1971 at the age of 52.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">LECTURES, BOOKS AND AWARDS</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">In 1967 Boyd presented the ABC’s Boyer Lectures and in 1970 published Living in Australia, a book of his later work,<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />including the house at 12 Marawa Place, Aranda. He was made a Life Fellow of the RAIA and was awarded the RAIA Gold<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;" />Medal in 1969.

There were probably only two privately practising architects in Canberra up until the<br>late 1940s—Kenneth Oliphant and Malcolm Moir—and aside from government architects Cuthbert Whitley and E H Henderson there was little apetite for the ideas of European modernism. Consequently, only a very small number of inter-war functionalist houses survive from this period, some being influenced by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe in Germany and W M Dudock in Holland.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Incidentally, Federal Capital Commission architecture from the 1920s and 1930s is unique to Canberra—but is not examined on this site.<br>The best coverage of FCC architecture can be found in The Early Canberra House 1911-1933, edited by Peter Freeman.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:spacer {"height":50} -->\n<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>\n<!-- /wp:spacer -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {"align":"right"} -->\n<h2 class="has-text-align-right">THE 1950S</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:columns -->\n<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column -->\n<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The population of Canberra grew to 50,000 during the 1950s. The decade saw the establishment of the Australian National University, gradual movement of Federal government departments to Canberra and the creation of the NCDC in 1957. The arrival of academics and senior government officials from Sydney and Melbourne accompanied these developments and it was not unusual for them to commission architects from their home cities to design their new houses in Canberra.<br>The presence of post-war Sydney and Melbourne streams of modernist residential architecture together is unusual and seldom found elsewhere in Australia.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the same time, the NCDC increased the amount of commissioned government work for public building, also attracting leading architects to Canberra.

By 1976 the population had reached 203,000. The Sydney regional style became more widespread in the early part of the decade, particularly in developing bushland suburbs such as Aranda.

The suburbs and town centre of Tuggeranong were constructed to the south, and the new town centre of Gungahlin planned in the north. Meanwhile, real estate values in inner suburbs increased significantly, reflecting a growing awareness and appreciation of the city’s history and heritage. The marked increase in the regeneration of central suburbs has provided opportunities for architects, and produced a number of interesting and award winning houses in this period.

The courtyard walls facing Dominion Circuit did not comply with local NCDC guidelines when constructed and were demolished. They were rebuilt at a later date on condition that they be hidden by a planting of bamboo, which remains to this day.</p>\n<p>The townhouses have a two storey height living space, which is screened by sliding doors from the dining, kitchen and entry area. Above this is a gallery with a built in desk, which overlooks the living area. Behind the gallery are two bedrooms, a dressing room and a bathroom.

Construction was completed in 1955. The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:group --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column -->\n\n<!-- wp:column -->\n<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:image {"id":325,"width":1024,"height":682,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bowden-house-1-photo-by-max-dupain-1-edited-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-325" width="1024" height="682"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {"style":{"color":{"background":"#e6ecee"}}} -->\n<div class="wp-block-group has-background" style="background-color:#e6ecee"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing.

The house is an early example of the post-war international style with its cubiform shape, Corbusian window motif, overhang for shade, plain smooth wall surfaces, contrasting textures and large sheets of glass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The original house was a rectangular split level plan positioned diagonally across the site, which slopes towards the street. The carport is excavated into the site at the lower side under the higher of the split levels. The house is constructed of random stone walls, rendered cavity brickwork, suspended concrete slabs, steel and timber roof framing and a metal deck roof.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The entry is approached up a cantilevered concrete stair with open treads and a simple pipe handrail. The stair is located under the roofline within the cubiform and given prominence by the random stone wall. The front door opens into a random stone paved lobby area behind a quarter height random stone fireplace with a tall, slender white rendered central chimney. The entry is on an axis with and parallel to the full height and full length living room north west glazing. The entry emphasises the positioning of different materials with the play of rough stone with glazing and smooth rendered walls. This was an important aspect of Seidler’s early work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:group --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column -->\n\n<!-- wp:column -->\n<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:image {"id":325,"width":1024,"height":682,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bowden-house-1-photo-by-max-dupain-1-edited-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-325" width="1024" height="682"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {"style":{"color":{"background":"#e6ecee"}}} -->\n<div class="wp-block-group has-background" style="background-color:#e6ecee"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The split level planning divides the residence into living spaces and rest areas. This design takes advantage of the interplay of horizontal and vertical space with planning themes centred on the living room. The panelled rear wall of the living room separates it from the upper sleeping areas. The room opens out into the north west through full height sliding glass doors to a terrace, which has a wide overhang angled to allow winter sun to penetrate into the room but exclude the hot summer sun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The upper sleeping level is accessed by an open tread timber stair, echoing the theme of the concrete entry stair. The corridor at this level is a secondary axis parallel to the main axis. Originally there was glazing at both ends of the house that allowed views along the corridor and into the landscape. The axis was emphasised externally by a stone blade wall extending east from the second bedroom, culminating at the west end in the balcony off the main bedroom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal"} -->\n<p class="has-normal-font-size">The upper level originally consisted of two bedrooms a study and a bathroom where the ceiling followed the pitch of the roof, as with the lower level. The planning themes involved the external form of the house extending into the landscape via the use of low level walls perpendicular to the perimeter walls of the house and adjacent to the glazing. This is reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe’s designs in the 1920s.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:group --></div>\n<!-- /wp:column --></div>\n<!-- /wp:columns -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"normal","style":{"color":{"background":"#e6ecee"}}} -->\n<p class="has-background has-normal-font-size" style="background-color:#e6ecee">Unfortunately the second alterations closed off the internal open view from the main bedroom down to the living room and enclosed the north east facing terrace to increase the size of the dining room. The cantilevered balcony off the main bedroom has also been enclosed, which has changed the appearance of the western facade. This was an important design feature, being an expression of the internal spaces, structure and architectural style.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"right"} -->\n<p class="has-text-align-right"><a href="http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/locations/" data-type="page" data-id="33">Back</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Bowden House', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '76-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-14 11:00:40', '2020-10-14 11:00:40', '', 76, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/14/76-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He is recognised as one of Australia’s leading architects of the modern movement and the first architect in Australia to fully express the principles of the Bauhaus. He designed many important residential and commercial buildings in Australia and overseas, introducing new ideas and construction techniques and making a major contribution to the architecture of Sydney. He was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1976 and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gold Medal in 1996. Seidler died on 9 March, 2006.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">BACKGROUND AND TRAINING</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">His background and training was unlike that of local architects: he had studied under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at the Harvard School of Design and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina with Joseph Albers. He also worked with Breuer at his New York practice and briefly with Oscar Niemeyer in Rio de Janeiro. Seidler decided to establish himself in Sydney in 1948 after visiting his parents, who had moved there.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY RESIDENTIAL WORK</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler’s first house was the Rose Seidler House at Turramurra (1948). The glass walled, elevated cubiform house was revolutionary and introduced the Bauhaus principles of Gropius and Breuer into Australia for the first time. Seidler continued to present these concepts to the Australian public over the following years with a series of extremely well detailed houses, executed either in the box-like form of Le Corbusier or the bi-nuclear plan of Marcel Breuer, with living and sleeping areas separated by an entry hall. Along the way many important battles were fought and won with councils over issues relating to design (the butterfly roof), planning and zoning regulations. Experimentation with different forms was made possible with the introduction of advanced structural techniques. Since the early 1960s the geometric curve has been a recurring theme in Seidler’s work, with the quadrant being a favoured form. This can be seen to good effect in the later houses detailed on Seidler’s website.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">With his apartment building projects, Seidler introduced ideas new to Sydney and Australia. Based largely on European and American apartment types, the split access, interlocking units with a divided plan, double height living rooms and mezzanine floors, took advantage of Sydney’s spectacular views from all main rooms. The Arlington Apartments at Edgecliff are a good example. The carefully composed facades of these buildings display abstract, asymmetrical, balanced patterns and are influenced by the European art movements of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">LARGER DEVELOPMENTS</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler’s office building developments in Australia and overseas are significant. In Sydney they were, in a number of instances, the first major buildings to contribute usable, public spaces back to the city, with the integrated development of office and retail space, parking and a public plaza. One of the first and most important of these was Australia Square (1961), which also saw the start of a fruitful partnership with the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi. It represented an advanced use of concrete, with the tower constructed of a poured in place concrete core with pre-cast units serving as both formwork and finish for the surrounding concrete frame.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">CANBERRA EXAMPLES</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">There are good examples of Seidler’s residential and commercial work in Canberra.

He is recognised as one of Australia’s leading architects of the modern movement and the first architect in Australia to fully express the principles of the Bauhaus. He designed many important residential and commercial buildings in Australia and overseas, introducing new ideas and construction techniques and making a major contribution to the architecture of Sydney. He was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1976 and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Gold Medal in 1996. Seidler died on 9 March, 2006.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">BACKGROUND AND TRAINING</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">His background and training was unlike that of local architects: he had studied under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer at the Harvard School of Design and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina with Joseph Albers. He also worked with Breuer at his New York practice and briefly with Oscar Niemeyer in Rio de Janeiro. Seidler decided to establish himself in Sydney in 1948 after visiting his parents, who had moved there.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">EARLY RESIDENTIAL WORK</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler’s first house was the Rose Seidler House at Turramurra (1948). The glass walled, elevated cubiform house was revolutionary and introduced the Bauhaus principles of Gropius and Breuer into Australia for the first time. Seidler continued to present these concepts to the Australian public over the following years with a series of extremely well detailed houses, executed either in the box-like form of Le Corbusier or the bi-nuclear plan of Marcel Breuer, with living and sleeping areas separated by an entry hall. Along the way many important battles were fought and won with councils over issues relating to design (the butterfly roof), planning and zoning regulations. Experimentation with different forms was made possible with the introduction of advanced structural techniques. Since the early 1960s the geometric curve has been a recurring theme in Seidler’s work, with the quadrant being a favoured form. This can be seen to good effect in the later houses detailed on Seidler’s website.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">With his apartment building projects, Seidler introduced ideas new to Sydney and Australia. Based largely on European and American apartment types, the split access, interlocking units with a divided plan, double height living rooms and mezzanine floors, took advantage of Sydney’s spectacular views from all main rooms. The Arlington Apartments at Edgecliff are a good example. The carefully composed facades of these buildings display abstract, asymmetrical, balanced patterns and are influenced by the European art movements of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">LARGER DEVELOPMENTS</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler’s office building developments in Australia and overseas are significant. In Sydney they were, in a number of instances, the first major buildings to contribute usable, public spaces back to the city, with the integrated development of office and retail space, parking and a public plaza. One of the first and most important of these was Australia Square (1961), which also saw the start of a fruitful partnership with the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi. It represented an advanced use of concrete, with the tower constructed of a poured in place concrete core with pre-cast units serving as both formwork and finish for the surrounding concrete frame.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">CANBERRA EXAMPLES</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">There are good examples of Seidler’s residential and commercial work in Canberra. His first commission outside Sydney (the Bowden House) exhibits his design philosophy of the early period. Medium density housing at Campbell is representative of his post-war international style apartment block developments, while the Lakeview townhouses are a good later example of his emphasis on the geometric curve and quadrant. The large, pre-cast concrete Barton Offices is an important office building located near the Parliamentary Triangle in Barton.</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">WORKS IN CANBERRA</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Bowden House, 11 Northcote Crescent, Deakin (1951-52)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">12 Yapunyah Street, O’Connor (1956)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Canberra South Bowling Club, Austin Street, Griffith (1959)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Campbell Group Housing, Blamey Crescent, Campbell (1964)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Garran Housing, Gilmore Crescent, Garran (1968; demolished 1999)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Ethos House, Ainslie Avenue, City (1970)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Barton Offices, Kings Avenue, Barton (1973)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Lakeview, 127 Hopetoun Circuit, Yarralumla (1982)</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">OTHER NOTABLE WORKS</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Rose Seidler House, Turramurra, NSW (1948)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Rose House, Turramurra, NSW (1949)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Waks House I, Northbridge, NSW (1949-51)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Meller House, Castlecrag, NSW (1950)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Lowe House, Mosman, NSW (1950)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Williamson House, Mosman, NSW (1951)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Hutter House, Turramurra, NSW (1952)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Ithaca Gardens apartments, Elizabeth Bay, NSW (1960)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Lend Lease House, Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW (1961)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Australia Square, Sydney, NSW (1961)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Blues Point Tower apartments, North Sydney, NSW (1961)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Muller House, Port Hacking, NSW (1963)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Arlington apartments, Edgecliff, NSW (1965-66)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Harry and Penelope Seidler House, Killara, NSW (1966-67)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Gissing House, Wahroonga, NSW (1971-72)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">MLC Centre, Sydney, NSW (1972)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Seidler Offices and Apartments, Milsons Point, NSW (1973)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Ringwood Cultural Centre, Ringwood, VIC (1978)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Grosvenor Place, Sydney, NSW (1982)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Waverley Civic Centre, Waverley, VIC (1982)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Hannes House, Cammeray, NSW (1983)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Capita Centre, Sydney, NSW (1984)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Shell Headquarters, Melbourne, VIC (1985)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">QVI Office Tower, Perth, WA (1987)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Hamilton House, Vaucluse, NSW (1989)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Horizon Apartments, Darlinghurst, NSW (1990)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Meares House, Birchgrove, NSW (1994)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Gilhotra House, Hunters Hill, NSW (1995)<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Berman House, Joadja, NSW (1996)</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">SOURCE</p>\n<p style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Peter Blake, Architecture for the New World: The Work of Harry Seidler, Sydney, 1973<br style="-webkit-user-select: auto;">Jennifer Taylor, Australian Architecture Since 1960, RAIA, 1990</p>', 'Harry Seidler', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '56-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-10-14 12:27:21', '2020-10-14 12:27:21', '', 56, 'http://127.0.0.1/11058-Assessment-2/2020/10/14/56-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
